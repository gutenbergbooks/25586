			<h3 class="story_title">Peter <a class="return_toc" href="#contents" title="Return to Contents">ToC</a></h3>

			<p class="return_toc"></p>

			<p class="first_paragraph">&#8220;No, Antone, I have told thee many times, no, thou shalt
			not sell it until I am gone.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;But I need money; what good is that old fiddle to thee?
			The very crows laugh at thee when thou art trying to play.
			Thy hand trembles so thou canst scarce hold the bow. Thou
			shalt go with me to the Blue to cut wood to-morrow. See to
			it thou art up early.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;What, on the Sabbath, Antone, when it is so cold? I get
			so very cold, my son, let us not go to-morrow.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;Yes, to-morrow, thou lazy old man. Do not I cut wood
			upon the Sabbath? Care I how cold it is? Wood thou shalt
			cut, and haul it too, and as for the fiddle, I tell thee I will sell
			it yet.&#8221; Antone pulled his ragged cap down over his low
			heavy brow, and went out. The old man drew his stool up
			nearer the fire, and sat stroking his violin with trembling fingers
			and muttering, &#8220;Not while I live, not while I live.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Five years ago they had come here, Peter Sadelack, and his
			wife, and oldest son Antone, and countless smaller Sadelacks,
			here to the dreariest part of south-western Nebraska, and had
			taken up a homestead. Antone was the acknowledged master
			of the premises, and people said he was a likely youth, and
			would do well. That he was mean and untrustworthy every
			one knew, but that made little difference. His corn was better
			tended than any in the county, and his wheat always yielded
			more than other men&#8217;s.</p>

			<p>Of Peter no one knew much, nor had any one a good word
			to say for him. He drank whenever he could get out of Antone&#8217;s
			sight long enough to pawn his hat or coat for whiskey.
			Indeed there were but two things he would not pawn, his
			pipe and his violin. He was a lazy, absent minded old fellow,
			who liked to fiddle better than to plow, though Antone surely
			got work enough out of them all, for that matter. In the
			house of which Antone was master there was no one, from
			the little boy three years old, to the old man of sixty, who did
			not earn his bread. Still people said that Peter was worthless,
			and was a great drag on Antone, his son, who never drank,
			<a class="pagenum" id="page2" title="2">&nbsp;</a>and was a much better man than his father had ever been.
			Peter did not care what people said. He did not like the country,
			nor the people, least of all he liked the plowing. He was
			very homesick for Bohemia. Long ago, only eight years ago
			by the calendar, but it seemed eight centuries to Peter, he had
			been a second violinist in the great theatre at Prague. He had
			gone into the theatre very young, and had been there all his
			life, until he had a stroke of paralysis, which made his arm so
			weak that his bowing was uncertain. Then they told him he
			could go. Those were great days at the theatre. He had plenty
			to drink then, and wore a dress coat every evening, and there
			were always parties after the play. He could play in those
			days, ay, that he could! He could never read the notes well, so
			he did not play first; but his touch, he had a touch indeed, so
			Herr Mikilsdoff, who led the orchestra, had said. Sometimes
			now Peter thought he could plow better if he could only bow
			as he used to. He had seen all the lovely women in the world
			there, all the great singers and the great players. He was in the
			orchestra when Rachel played, and he heard Liszt play when
			the Countess d&#8217;Agoult sat in the stage box and threw the master
			white lilies. Once, a French woman came and played for
			weeks, he did not remember her name now. He did not remember
			her face very well either, for it changed so, it was
			never twice the same. But the beauty of it, and the great hunger
			men felt at the sight of it, that he remembered. Most of all
			he remembered her voice. He did not know French, and
			could not understand a word she said, but it seemed to him
			that she must be talking the music of Chopin. And her voice,
			he thought he should know that in the other world. The last
			night she played a play in which a man touched her arm, and
			she stabbed him. As Peter sat among the smoking gas jets
			down below the footlights with his fiddle on his knee, and
			looked up at her, he thought he would like to die too, if he
			could touch her arm once, and have her stab him so. Peter
			went home to his wife very drunk that night. Even in those
			days he was a foolish fellow, who cared for nothing but music
			and pretty faces.</p>

			<p>It was all different now. He had nothing to drink and little
			to eat, and here, there was nothing but sun, and grass, and
			sky. He had forgotten almost everything, but some things he
			<a class="pagenum" id="page3" title="3">&nbsp;</a>remembered well enough. He loved his violin and the holy
			Mary, and above all else he feared the Evil One, and his son
			Antone.</p>

			<p>The fire was low, and it grew cold. Still Peter sat by the fire
			remembering. He dared not throw more cobs on the fire; Antone
			would be angry. He did not want to cut wood tomorrow,
			it would be Sunday, and he wanted to go to mass.
			Antone might let him do that. He held his violin under his
			wrinkled chin, his white hair fell over it, and he began to play
			&#8220;Ave Maria.&#8221; His hand shook more than ever before, and at
			last refused to work the bow at all. He sat stupefied for a
			while, then arose, and taking his violin with him, stole out
			into the old sod stable. He took Antone&#8217;s shot-gun down
			from its peg, and loaded it by the moonlight which streamed
			in through the door. He sat down on the dirt floor, and
			leaned back against the dirt wall. He heard the wolves howling
			in the distance, and the night wind screaming as it swept
			over the snow. Near him he heard the regular breathing of
			the horses in the dark. He put his crucifix above his heart, and
			folding his hands said brokenly all the Latin he had ever
			known, &#8220;<em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pater noster, qui in cælum est.</em>&#8221; Then he raised his
			head and sighed, &#8220;Not one kreutzer will Antone pay them to
			pray for my soul, not one kreutzer, he is so careful of his
			money, is Antone, he does not waste it in drink, he is a better
			man than I, but hard sometimes. He works the girls too hard,
			women were not made to work so. But he shall not sell thee,
			my fiddle, I can play thee no more, but they shall not part us.
			We have seen it all together, and we will forget it together,
			the French woman and all.&#8221; He held his fiddle under his chin
			a moment, where it had lain so often, then put it across his
			knee and broke it through the middle. He pulled off his old
			boot, held the gun between his knees with the muzzle against
			his forehead, and pressed the trigger with his toe.</p>

			<p>In the morning Antone found him stiff, frozen fast in a
			pool of blood. They could not straighten him out enough to
			fit a coffin, so they buried him in a pine box. Before the funeral
			Antone carried to town the fiddle-bow which Peter had
			forgotten to break. Antone was very thrifty, and a better man
			than his father had been.</p>

			<h3 class="story_title">On the Divide <a class="return_toc" href="#contents" title="Return to Contents">ToC</a></h3>

			<p class="first_paragraph">Near Rattlesnake Creek, on the side of a little draw
			stood Canute&#8217;s shanty. North, east, south, stretched the
			level Nebraska plain of long rust-red grass that undulated
			constantly in the wind. To the west the ground was broken
			and rough, and a narrow strip of timber wound along the
			turbid, muddy little stream that had scarcely ambition enough
			to crawl over its black bottom. If it had not been for the few
			stunted cottonwoods and elms that grew along its banks,
			Canute would have shot himself years ago. The Norwegians
			are a timber-loving people, and if there is even a turtle pond
			with a few plum bushes around it they seem irresistibly drawn
			toward it.</p>

			<p>As to the shanty itself, Canute had built it without aid of
			any kind, for when he first squatted along the banks of Rattlesnake
			Creek there was not a human being within twenty
			miles. It was built of logs split in halves, the chinks stopped
			with mud and plaster. The roof was covered with earth and
			was supported by one gigantic beam curved in the shape of a
			round arch. It was almost impossible that any tree had ever
			grown in that shape. The Norwegians used to say that Canute
			had taken the log across his knee and bent it into the shape
			he wished. There were two rooms, or rather there was one
			room with a partition made of ash saplings interwoven and
			bound together like big straw basket work. In one corner
			there was a cook stove, rusted and broken. In the other a bed
			made of unplaned planks and poles. It was fully eight feet
			long, and upon it was a heap of dark bed clothing. There was
			a chair and a bench of colossal proportions. There was an
			ordinary kitchen cupboard with a few cracked dirty dishes in
			it, and beside it on a tall box a tin wash-basin. Under the bed
			was a pile of pint flasks, some broken, some whole, all empty.
			On the wood box lay a pair of shoes of almost incredible
			dimensions. On the wall hung a saddle, a gun, and some
			ragged clothing, conspicuous among which was a suit of dark
			cloth, apparently new, with a paper collar carefully wrapped
			in a red silk handkerchief and pinned to the sleeve. Over the
			<a class="pagenum" id="page5" title="5">&nbsp;</a>door hung a wolf and a badger skin, and on the door itself a
			brace of thirty or forty snake skins whose noisy tails rattled
			ominously every time it opened. The strangest things in the
			shanty were the wide window-sills. At first glance they looked
			as though they had been ruthlessly hacked and mutilated with
			a hatchet, but on closer inspection all the notches and holes
			in the wood took form and shape. There seemed to be a series
			of pictures. They were, in a rough way, artistic, but the
			figures were heavy and labored, as though they had been cut
			very slowly and with very awkward instruments. There were
			men plowing with little horned imps sitting on their shoulders
			and on their horses&#8217; heads. There were men praying with
			a skull hanging over their heads and little demons behind
			them mocking their attitudes. There were men fighting with
			big serpents, and skeletons dancing together. All about these
			pictures were blooming vines and foliage such as never grew
			in this world, and coiled among the branches of the vines
			there was always the scaly body of a serpent, and behind every
			flower there was a serpent&#8217;s head. It was a veritable Dance of
			Death by one who had felt its sting. In the wood box lay
			some boards, and every inch of them was cut up in the same
			manner. Sometimes the work was very rude and careless, and
			looked as though the hand of the workman had trembled. It
			would sometimes have been hard to distinguish the men from
			their evil geniuses but for one fact, the men were always grave
			and were either toiling or praying, while the devils were always
			smiling and dancing. Several of these boards had been
			split for kindling and it was evident that the artist did not
			value his work highly.</p>

			<p>It was the first day of winter on the Divide. Canute stumbled
			into his shanty carrying a basket of cobs, and after filling
			the stove, sat down on a stool and crouched his seven foot
			frame over the fire, staring drearily out of the window at the
			wide gray sky. He knew by heart every individual clump of
			bunch grass in the miles of red shaggy prairie that stretched
			before his cabin. He knew it in all the deceitful loveliness of
			its early summer, in all the bitter barrenness of its autumn.
			He had seen it smitten by all the plagues of Egypt. He had
			seen it parched by drought, and sogged by rain, beaten by
			hail, and swept by fire, and in the grasshopper years he had
			<a class="pagenum" id="page6" title="6">&nbsp;</a>seen it eaten as bare and clean as bones that the vultures have
			left. After the great fires he had seen it stretch for miles and
			miles, black and smoking as the floor of hell.</p>

			<p>He rose slowly and crossed the room, dragging his big feet
			heavily as though they were burdens to him. He looked out
			of the window into the hog corral and saw the pigs burying
			themselves in the straw before the shed. The leaden gray
			clouds were beginning to spill themselves, and the snowflakes
			were settling down over the white leprous patches of
			frozen earth where the hogs had gnawed even the sod away.
			He shuddered and began to walk, tramping heavily with his
			ungainly feet. He was the wreck of ten winters on the Divide
			and he knew what they meant. Men fear the winters of the
			Divide as a child fears night or as men in the North Seas fear
			the still dark cold of the polar twilight.</p>

			<p>His eyes fell upon his gun, and he took it down from the
			wall and looked it over. He sat down on the edge of his bed
			and held the barrel towards his face, letting his forehead rest
			upon it, and laid his finger on the trigger. He was perfectly
			calm, there was neither passion nor despair in his face, but
			the thoughtful look of a man who is considering. Presently
			he laid down the gun, and reaching into the cupboard, drew
			out a pint bottle of raw white alcohol. Lifting it to his lips,
			he drank greedily. He washed his face in the tin basin and
			combed his rough hair and shaggy blond beard. Then he
			stood in uncertainty before the suit of dark clothes that hung
			on the wall. For the fiftieth time he took them in his hands
			and tried to summon courage to put them on. He took the
			paper collar that was pinned to the sleeve of the coat and
			cautiously slipped it under his rough beard, looking with
			timid expectancy into the cracked, splashed glass that hung
			over the bench. With a short laugh he threw it down on the
			bed, and pulling on his old black hat, he went out, striking
			off across the level.</p>

			<p>It was a physical necessity for him to get away from his
			cabin once in a while. He had been there for ten years, digging
			and plowing and sowing, and reaping what little the hail
			and the hot winds and the frosts left him to reap. Insanity
			and suicide are very common things on the Divide. They
			come on like an epidemic in the hot wind season. Those
			<a class="pagenum" id="page7" title="7">&nbsp;</a>scorching dusty winds that blow up over the bluffs from
			Kansas seem to dry up the blood in men&#8217;s veins as they do
			the sap in the corn leaves. Whenever the yellow scorch
			creeps down over the tender inside leaves about the ear, then
			the coroners prepare for active duty; for the oil of the country
			is burned out and it does not take long for the flame to
			eat up the wick. It causes no great sensation there when a
			Dane is found swinging to his own windmill tower, and
			most of the Poles after they have become too careless and
			discouraged to shave themselves keep their razors to cut
			their throats with.</p>

			<p>It may be that the next generation on the Divide will be
			very happy, but the present one came too late in life. It is
			useless for men that have cut hemlocks among the mountains
			of Sweden for forty years to try to be happy in a country
			as flat and gray and as naked as the sea. It is not easy for
			men that have spent their youths fishing in the Northern
			seas to be content with following a plow, and men that have
			served in the Austrian army hate hard work and coarse
			clothing and the loneliness of the plains, and long for
			marches and excitement and tavern company and pretty barmaids.
			After a man has passed his fortieth birthday it is not
			easy for him to change the habits and conditions of his life.
			Most men bring with them to the Divide only the dregs of
			the lives that they have squandered in other lands and
			among other peoples.</p>

			<p>Canute Canuteson was as mad as any of them, but his
			madness did not take the form of suicide or religion but of
			alcohol. He had always taken liquor when he wanted it, as all
			Norwegians do, but after his first year of solitary life he settled
			down to it steadily. He exhausted whisky after a while,
			and went to alcohol, because its effects were speedier and
			surer. He was a big man with a terrible amount of resistant
			force, and it took a great deal of alcohol even to move him.
			After nine years of drinking, the quantities he could take
			would seem fabulous to an ordinary drinking man. He never
			let it interfere with his work, he generally drank at night and
			on Sundays. Every night, as soon as his chores were done, he
			began to drink. While he was able to sit up he would play on
			his mouth harp or hack away at his window sills with his jack
			<a class="pagenum" id="page8" title="8">&nbsp;</a>knife. When the liquor went to his head he would lie down
			on his bed and stare out of the window until he went to
			sleep. He drank alone and in solitude not for pleasure or
			good cheer, but to forget the awful loneliness and level of the
			Divide. Milton made a sad blunder when he put mountains
			in hell. Mountains postulate faith and aspiration. All mountain
			peoples are religious. It was the cities of the plains that,
			because of their utter lack of spirituality and the mad caprice
			of their vice, were cursed of God.</p>

			<p>Alcohol is perfectly consistent in its effects upon man.
			Drunkenness is merely an exaggeration. A foolish man drunk
			becomes maudlin; a bloody man, vicious; a coarse man,
			vulgar. Canute was none of these, but he was morose and
			gloomy, and liquor took him through all the hells of Dante.
			As he lay on his giant&#8217;s bed all the horrors of this world and
			every other were laid bare to his chilled senses. He was a man
			who knew no joy, a man who toiled in silence and bitterness.
			The skull and the serpent were always before him, the symbols
			of eternal futileness and of eternal hate.</p>

			<p>When the first Norwegians near enough to be called
			neighbors came, Canute rejoiced, and planned to escape
			from his bosom vice. But he was not a social man by nature
			and had not the power of drawing out the social side of
			other people. His new neighbors rather feared him because
			of his great strength and size, his silence and his lowering
			brows. Perhaps, too, they knew that he was mad, mad from
			the eternal treachery of the plains, which every spring stretch
			green and rustle with the promises of Eden, showing long
			grassy lagoons full of clear water and cattle whose hoofs are
			stained with wild roses. Before autumn the lagoons are dried
			up, and the ground is burnt dry and hard until it blisters
			and cracks open.</p>

			<p>So instead of becoming a friend and neighbor to the men
			that settled about him, Canute became a mystery and a terror.
			They told awful stories of his size and strength and of the
			alcohol he drank. They said that one night, when he went out
			to see to his horses just before he went to bed, his steps were
			unsteady and the rotten planks of the floor gave way and
			threw him behind the feet of a fiery young stallion. His foot
			was caught fast in the floor, and the nervous horse began
			<a class="pagenum" id="page9" title="9">&nbsp;</a>kicking frantically. When Canute felt the blood trickling down
			in his eyes from a scalp wound in his head, he roused himself
			from his kingly indifference, and with the quiet stoical courage
			of a drunken man leaned forward and wound his arms
			about the horse&#8217;s hind legs and held them against his breast
			with crushing embrace. All through the darkness and cold of
			the night he lay there, matching strength against strength.
			When little Jim Peterson went over the next morning at four
			o&#8217;clock to go with him to the Blue to cut wood, he found him
			so, and the horse was on its fore knees, trembling and
			whinnying with fear. This is the story the Norwegians tell of
			him, and if it is true it is no wonder that they feared and
			hated this Holder of the Heels of Horses.</p>

			<p>One spring there moved to the next &#8220;eighty&#8221; a family that
			made a great change in Canute&#8217;s life. Ole Yensen was too
			drunk most of the time to be afraid of any one, and his wife
			Mary was too garrulous to be afraid of any one who listened
			to her talk, and Lena, their pretty daughter, was not afraid of
			man nor devil. So it came about that Canute went over to
			take his alcohol with Ole oftener than he took it alone. After
			a while the report spread that he was going to marry Yensen&#8217;s
			daughter, and the Norwegian girls began to tease Lena about
			the great bear she was going to keep house for. No one could
			quite see how the affair had come about, for Canute&#8217;s tactics
			of courtship were somewhat peculiar. He apparently never
			spoke to her at all: he would sit for hours with Mary chattering
			on one side of him and Ole drinking on the other and
			watch Lena at her work. She teased him, and threw flour in
			his face and put vinegar in his coffee, but he took her rough
			jokes with silent wonder, never even smiling. He took her to
			church occasionally, but the most watchful and curious people
			never saw him speak to her. He would sit staring at her
			while she giggled and flirted with the other men.</p>

			<p>Next spring Mary Lee went to town to work in a steam
			laundry. She came home every Sunday, and always ran across
			to Yensens to startle Lena with stories of ten cent theaters,
			firemen&#8217;s dances, and all the other esthetic delights of metropolitan
			life. In a few weeks Lena&#8217;s head was completely
			turned, and she gave her father no rest until he let her go to
			town to seek her fortune at the ironing board. From the time
			<a class="pagenum" id="page10" title="10">&nbsp;</a>she came home on her first visit she began to treat Canute
			with contempt. She had bought a plush cloak and kid gloves,
			had her clothes made by the dress-maker, and assumed airs
			and graces that made the other women of the neighborhood
			cordially detest her. She generally brought with her a young
			man from town who waxed his mustache and wore a red
			necktie, and she did not even introduce him to Canute.</p>

			<p>The neighbors teased Canute a good deal until he
			knocked one of them down. He gave no sign of suffering
			from her neglect except that he drank more and avoided the
			other Norwegians more carefully than ever. He lay around
			in his den and no one knew what he felt or thought, but
			little Jim Peterson, who had seen him glowering at Lena in
			church one Sunday when she was there with the town man,
			said that he would not give an acre of his wheat for Lena&#8217;s
			life or the town chap&#8217;s either; and Jim&#8217;s wheat was so wondrously
			worthless that the statement was an exceedingly
			strong one.</p>

			<p>Canute had bought a new suit of clothes that looked as
			nearly like the town man&#8217;s as possible. They had cost him half
			a millet crop; for tailors are not accustomed to fitting giants
			and they charge for it. He had hung those clothes in his
			shanty two months ago and had never put them on, partly
			from fear of ridicule, partly from discouragement, and partly
			because there was something in his own soul that revolted at
			the littleness of the device.</p>

			<p>Lena was at home just at this time. Work was slack in the
			laundry and Mary had not been well, so Lena stayed at home,
			glad enough to get an opportunity to torment Canute once
			more.</p>

			<p>She was washing in the side kitchen, singing loudly as she
			worked. Mary was on her knees, blacking the stove and scolding
			violently about the young man who was coming out from
			town that night. The young man had committed the fatal
			error of laughing at Mary&#8217;s ceaseless babble and had never
			been forgiven.</p>

			<p>&#8220;He is no good, and you will come to a bad end by running
			with him! I do not see why a daughter of mine should
			act so. I do not see why the Lord should visit such a punishment
			<a class="pagenum" id="page11" title="11">&nbsp;</a>upon me as to give me such a daughter. There are
			plenty of good men you can marry.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Lena tossed her head and answered curtly, &#8220;I don&#8217;t happen
			to want to marry any man right away, and so long as Dick
			dresses nice and has plenty of money to spend, there is no
			harm in my going with him.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;Money to spend? Yes, and that is all he does with it I&#8217;ll be
			bound. You think it very fine now, but you will change your
			tune when you have been married five years and see your children
			running naked and your cupboard empty. Did Anne
			Hermanson come to any good end by marrying a town man?&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know anything about Anne Hermanson, but I
			know any of the laundry girls would have Dick quick enough
			if they could get him.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;Yes, and a nice lot of store clothes huzzies you are too.
			Now there is Canuteson who has an &#8216;eighty&#8217; proved up and
			fifty head of cattle and&#8212;&#8212;&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;And hair that ain&#8217;t been cut since he was a baby, and a big
			dirty beard, and he wears overalls on Sundays, and drinks like
			a pig. Besides he will keep. I can have all the fun I want, and
			when I am old and ugly like you he can have me and take care
			of me. The Lord knows there ain&#8217;t nobody else going to
			marry him.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Canute drew his hand back from the latch as though it
			were red hot. He was not the kind of a man to make a good
			eavesdropper, and he wished he had knocked sooner. He
			pulled himself together and struck the door like a battering
			ram. Mary jumped and opened it with a screech.</p>

			<p>&#8220;God! Canute, how you scared us! I thought it was crazy
			Lou,&#8212;he has been tearing around the neighborhood trying
			to convert folks. I am afraid as death of him. He ought to be
			sent off, I think. He is just as liable as not to kill us all, or
			burn the barn, or poison the dogs. He has been worrying
			even the poor minister to death, and he laid up with the rheumatism,
			too! Did you notice that he was too sick to preach
			last Sunday? But don&#8217;t stand there in the cold,&#8212;come in.
			Yensen isn&#8217;t here, but he just went over to Sorenson&#8217;s for the
			mail; he won&#8217;t be gone long. Walk right in the other room
			and sit down.&#8221;</p>

			<p><a class="pagenum" id="page12" title="12">&nbsp;</a>Canute followed her, looking steadily in front of him and
			not noticing Lena as he passed her. But Lena&#8217;s vanity would
			not allow him to pass unmolested. She took the wet sheet
			she was wringing out and cracked him across the face with it,
			and ran giggling to the other side of the room. The blow
			stung his cheeks and the soapy water flew in his eyes, and he
			involuntarily began rubbing them with his hands. Lena giggled
			with delight at his discomfiture, and the wrath in Canute&#8217;s
			face grew blacker than ever. A big man humiliated is
			vastly more undignified than a little one. He forgot the sting
			of his face in the bitter consciousness that he had made a
			fool of himself. He stumbled blindly into the living room,
			knocking his head against the door jamb because he forgot
			to stoop. He dropped into a chair behind the stove, thrusting
			his big feet back helplessly on either side of him.</p>

			<p>Ole was a long time in coming, and Canute sat there, still
			and silent, with his hands clenched on his knees, and the skin
			of his face seemed to have shriveled up into little wrinkles that
			trembled when he lowered his brows. His life had been one
			long lethargy of solitude and alcohol, but now he was awakening,
			and it was as when the dumb stagnant heat of summer
			breaks out into thunder.</p>

			<p>When Ole came staggering in, heavy with liquor, Canute
			rose at once.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Yensen,&#8221; he said quietly, &#8220;I have come to see if you will let
			me marry your daughter today.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;Today!&#8221; gasped Ole.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Yes, I will not wait until tomorrow. I am tired of living
			alone.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Ole braced his staggering knees against the bedstead, and
			stammered eloquently: &#8220;Do you think I will marry my daughter
			to a drunkard? a man who drinks raw alcohol? a man who
			sleeps with rattle snakes? Get out of my house or I will kick
			you out for your impudence.&#8221; And Ole began looking anxiously
			for his feet.</p>

			<p>Canute answered not a word, but he put on his hat and
			went out into the kitchen. He went up to Lena and said without
			looking at her, &#8220;Get your things on and come with me!&#8221;</p>

			<p>The tones of his voice startled her, and she said angrily,
			dropping the soap, &#8220;Are you drunk?&#8221;</p>

			<p><a class="pagenum" id="page13" title="13">&nbsp;</a>&#8220;If you do not come with me, I will take you,&#8212;you had
			better come,&#8221; said Canute quietly.</p>

			<p>She lifted a sheet to strike him, but he caught her arm
			roughly and wrenched the sheet from her. He turned to the
			wall and took down a hood and shawl that hung there, and
			began wrapping her up. Lena scratched and fought like a wild
			thing. Ole stood in the door, cursing, and Mary howled and
			screeched at the top of her voice. As for Canute, he lifted the
			girl in his arms and went out of the house. She kicked and
			struggled, but the helpless wailing of Mary and Ole soon died
			away in the distance, and her face was held down tightly on
			Canute&#8217;s shoulder so that she could not see whither he was
			taking her. She was conscious only of the north wind whistling
			in her ears, and of rapid steady motion and of a great
			breast that heaved beneath her in quick, irregular breaths. The
			harder she struggled the tighter those iron arms that had held
			the heels of horses crushed about her, until she felt as if they
			would crush the breath from her, and lay still with fear.
			Canute was striding across the level fields at a pace at which
			man never went before, drawing the stinging north wind into
			his lungs in great gulps. He walked with his eyes half closed
			and looking straight in front of him, only lowering them
			when he bent his head to blow away the snow flakes that
			settled on her hair. So it was that Canute took her to his
			home, even as his bearded barbarian ancestors took the fair
			frivolous women of the South in their hairy arms and bore
			them down to their war ships. For ever and anon the soul
			becomes weary of the conventions that are not of it, and
			with a single stroke shatters the civilized lies with which it is
			unable to cope, and the strong arm reaches out and takes by
			force what it cannot win by cunning.</p>

			<p>When Canute reached his shanty he placed the girl upon a
			chair, where she sat sobbing. He stayed only a few minutes.
			He filled the stove with wood and lit the lamp, drank a huge
			swallow of alcohol and put the bottle in his pocket. He
			paused a moment, staring heavily at the weeping girl, then he
			went off and locked the door and disappeared in the gathering
			gloom of the night.</p>

			<p>Wrapped in flannels and soaked with turpentine, the little
			Norwegian preacher sat reading his Bible, when he heard a
			<a class="pagenum" id="page14" title="14">&nbsp;</a>thundering knock at his door, and Canute entered, covered
			with snow and with his beard frozen fast to his coat.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Come in, Canute, you must be frozen,&#8221; said the little man,
			shoving a chair towards his visitor.</p>

			<p>Canute remained standing with his hat on and said quietly,
			&#8220;I want you to come over to my house tonight to marry me
			to Lena Yensen.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;Have you got a license, Canute?&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;No, I don&#8217;t want a license. I want to be married.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;But I can&#8217;t marry you without a license, man. It would
			not be legal.&#8221;</p>

			<p>A dangerous light came in the big Norwegian&#8217;s eye. &#8220;I
			want you to come over to my house to marry me to Lena
			Yensen.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;No, I can&#8217;t, it would kill an ox to go out in a storm like
			this, and my rheumatism is bad tonight.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;Then if you will not go I must take you,&#8221; said Canute
			with a sigh.</p>

			<p>He took down the preacher&#8217;s bearskin coat and bade him
			put it on while he hitched up his buggy. He went out and
			closed the door softly after him. Presently he returned and
			found the frightened minister crouching before the fire with
			his coat lying beside him. Canute helped him put it on and
			gently wrapped his head in his big muffler. Then he picked
			him up and carried him out and placed him in his buggy. As
			he tucked the buffalo robes around him he said: &#8220;Your horse
			is old, he might flounder or lose his way in this storm. I will
			lead him.&#8221;</p>

			<p>The minister took the reins feebly in his hands and sat
			shivering with the cold. Sometimes when there was a lull in
			the wind, he could see the horse struggling through the snow
			with the man plodding steadily beside him. Again the blowing
			snow would hide them from him altogether. He had no
			idea where they were or what direction they were going. He
			felt as though he were being whirled away in the heart of the
			storm, and he said all the prayers he knew. But at last the
			long four miles were over, and Canute set him down in the
			snow while he unlocked the door. He saw the bride sitting
			by the fire with her eyes red and swollen as though she had
			<a class="pagenum" id="page15" title="15">&nbsp;</a>been weeping. Canute placed a huge chair for him, and said
			roughly,&#8212;</p>

			<p>&#8220;Warm yourself.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Lena began to cry and moan afresh, begging the minister
			to take her home. He looked helplessly at Canute. Canute
			said simply,&#8212;</p>

			<p>&#8220;If you are warm now, you can marry us.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;My daughter, do you take this step of your own free will?&#8221;
			asked the minister in a trembling voice.</p>

			<p>&#8220;No sir, I don&#8217;t, and it is disgraceful he should force me
			into it! I won&#8217;t marry him.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;Then, Canute, I cannot marry you,&#8221; said the minister,
			standing as straight as his rheumatic limbs would let him.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Are you ready to marry us now, sir?&#8221; said Canute, laying
			one iron hand on his stooped shoulder. The little preacher
			was a good man, but like most men of weak body he was a
			coward and had a horror of physical suffering, although he
			had known so much of it. So with many qualms of conscience
			he began to repeat the marriage service. Lena sat sullenly in
			her chair, staring at the fire. Canute stood beside her, listening
			with his head bent reverently and his hands folded on his
			breast. When the little man had prayed and said amen, Canute
			began bundling him up again.</p>

			<p>&#8220;I will take you home, now,&#8221; he said as he carried him
			out and placed him in his buggy, and started off with him
			through the fury of the storm, floundering among the snow
			drifts that brought even the giant himself to his knees.</p>

			<p>After she was left alone, Lena soon ceased weeping. She
			was not of a particularly sensitive temperament, and had little
			pride beyond that of vanity. After the first bitter anger wore
			itself out, she felt nothing more than a healthy sense of
			humiliation and defeat. She had no inclination to run away,
			for she was married now, and in her eyes that was final and
			all rebellion was useless. She knew nothing about a license,
			but she knew that a preacher married folks. She consoled herself
			by thinking that she had always intended to marry Canute
			some day, any way.</p>

			<p>She grew tired of crying and looking into the fire, so she
			got up and began to look about her. She had heard queer
			<a class="pagenum" id="page16" title="16">&nbsp;</a>tales about the inside of Canute&#8217;s shanty, and her curiosity
			soon got the better of her rage. One of the first things she
			noticed was the new black suit of clothes hanging on the wall.
			She was dull, but it did not take a vain woman long to interpret
			anything so decidedly flattering, and she was pleased in
			spite of herself. As she looked through the cupboard, the
			general air of neglect and discomfort made her pity the man
			who lived there.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Poor fellow, no wonder he wants to get married to get
			somebody to wash up his dishes. Batchin&#8217;s pretty hard on a
			man.&#8221;</p>

			<p>It is easy to pity when once one&#8217;s vanity has been tickled.
			She looked at the window sill and gave a little shudder and
			wondered if the man were crazy. Then she sat down again and
			sat a long time wondering what her Dick and Ole would do.</p>

			<p>&#8220;It is queer Dick didn&#8217;t come right over after me. He
			surely came, for he would have left town before the storm
			began and he might just as well come right on as go back. If
			he&#8217;d hurried he would have gotten here before the preacher
			came. I suppose he was afraid to come, for he knew Canuteson
			could pound him to jelly, the coward!&#8221; Her eyes flashed
			angrily.</p>

			<p>The weary hours wore on and Lena began to grow horribly
			lonesome. It was an uncanny night and this was an uncanny
			place to be in. She could hear the coyotes howling hungrily a
			little way from the cabin, and more terrible still were all the
			unknown noises of the storm. She remembered the tales they
			told of the big log overhead and she was afraid of those snaky
			things on the window sills. She remembered the man who
			had been killed in the draw, and she wondered what she
			would do if she saw crazy Lou&#8217;s white face glaring into the
			window. The rattling of the door became unbearable, she
			thought the latch must be loose and took the lamp to look at
			it. Then for the first time she saw the ugly brown snake skins
			whose death rattle sounded every time the wind jarred the
			door.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Canute, Canute!&#8221; she screamed in terror.</p>

			<p>Outside the door she heard a heavy sound as of a big dog
			getting up and shaking himself. The door opened and Canute
			stood before her, white as a snow drift.</p>

			<p><a class="pagenum" id="page17" title="17">&nbsp;</a>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; he asked kindly.</p>

			<p>&#8220;I am cold,&#8221; she faltered.</p>

			<p>He went out and got an armful of wood and a basket of
			cobs and filled the stove. Then he went out and lay in the
			snow before the door. Presently he heard her calling again.</p>

			<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; he said, sitting up.</p>

			<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m so lonesome, I&#8217;m afraid to stay in here all alone.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;I will go over and get your mother.&#8221; And he got up.</p>

			<p>&#8220;She won&#8217;t come.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll bring her,&#8221; said Canute grimly.</p>

			<p>&#8220;No, no. I don&#8217;t want her, she will scold all the time.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;Well, I will bring your father.&#8221;</p>

			<p>She spoke again and it seemed as though her mouth was
			close up to the key-hole. She spoke lower than he had ever
			heard her speak before, so low that he had to put his ear up to
			the lock to hear her.</p>

			<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want him either, Canute,&#8212;I&#8217;d rather have you.&#8221;</p>

			<p>For a moment she heard no noise at all, then something
			like a groan. With a cry of fear she opened the door, and saw
			Canute stretched in the snow at her feet, his face in his hands,
			sobbing on the door step.</p>

			<h4>I.</h4>

			<p class="first_paragraph">It was a great night at the Lone Star schoolhouse&#8212;a night
			when the Spirit was present with power and when God
			was very near to man. So it seemed to Asa Skinner, servant of
			God and Free Gospeller. The schoolhouse was crowded with
			the saved and sanctified, robust men and women, trembling
			and quailing before the power of some mysterious psychic
			force. Here and there among this cowering, sweating multitude
			crouched some poor wretch who had felt the pangs of an
			awakened conscience, but had not yet experienced that complete
			divestment of reason, that frenzy born of a convulsion
			of the mind, which, in the parlance of the Free Gospellers, is
			termed &#8220;the Light.&#8221; On the floor, before the mourners&#8217;
			bench, lay the unconscious figure of a man in whom outraged
			nature had sought her last resort. This &#8220;trance&#8221; state is the
			highest evidence of grace among the Free Gospellers, and indicates
			a close walking with God.</p>

			<p>Before the desk stood Asa Skinner, shouting of the mercy
			and vengeance of God, and in his eyes shone a terrible earnestness,
			an almost prophetic flame. Asa was a converted train
			gambler who used to run between Omaha and Denver. He
			was a man made for the extremes of life; from the most debauched
			of men he had become the most ascetic. His was a
			bestial face, a face that bore the stamp of Nature&#8217;s eternal
			injustice. The forehead was low, projecting over the eyes, and
			the sandy hair was plastered down over it and then brushed
			back at an abrupt right angle. The chin was heavy, the nostrils
			were low and wide, and the lower lip hung loosely except in
			his moments of spasmodic earnestness, when it shut like a
			steel trap. Yet about those coarse features there were deep,
			rugged furrows, the scars of many a hand-to-hand struggle
			with the weakness of the flesh, and about that drooping lip
			were sharp, strenuous lines that had conquered it and taught
			it to pray. Over those seamed cheeks there was a certain pallor,
			a grayness caught from many a vigil. It was as though,
			after Nature had done her worst with that face, some fine
			<a class="pagenum" id="page19" title="19">&nbsp;</a>chisel had gone over it, chastening and almost transfiguring it.
			To-night, as his muscles twitched with emotion, and the perspiration
			dropped from his hair and chin, there was a certain
			convincing power in the man. For Asa Skinner was a man
			possessed of a belief, of that sentiment of the sublime before
			which all inequalities are leveled, that transport of conviction
			which seems superior to all laws of condition, under which
			debauchees have become martyrs; which made a tinker an artist
			and a camel-driver the founder of an empire. This was with
			Asa Skinner to-night, as he stood proclaiming the vengeance
			of God.</p>

			<p>It might have occurred to an impartial observer that Asa
			Skinner&#8217;s God was indeed a vengeful God if he could reserve
			vengeance for those of his creatures who were packed into the
			Lone Star schoolhouse that night. Poor exiles of all nations;
			men from the south and the north, peasants from almost every
			country of Europe, most of them from the mountainous,
			night-bound coast of Norway. Honest men for the most part,
			but men with whom the world had dealt hardly; the failures
			of all countries, men sobered by toil and saddened by exile,
			who had been driven to fight for the dominion of an untoward
			soil, to sow where others should gather, the advance-guard
			of a mighty civilization to be.</p>

			<p>Never had Asa Skinner spoken more earnestly than now.
			He felt that the Lord had this night a special work for him to
			do. To-night Eric Hermannson, the wildest lad on all the Divide,
			sat in his audience with a fiddle on his knee, just as he
			had dropped in on his way to play for some dance. The violin
			is an object of particular abhorrence to the Free Gospellers.
			Their antagonism to the church organ is bitter enough, but
			the fiddle they regard as a very incarnation of evil desires,
			singing forever of worldly pleasures and inseparably associated
			with all forbidden things.</p>

			<p>Eric Hermannson had long been the object of the prayers
			of the revivalists. His mother had felt the power of the Spirit
			weeks ago, and special prayer-meetings had been held at her
			house for her son. But Eric had only gone his ways laughing,
			the ways of youth, which are short enough at best, and none
			too flowery on the Divide. He slipped away from the prayer-meetings
			to meet the Campbell boys in Genereau&#8217;s saloon, or
			<a class="pagenum" id="page20" title="20">&nbsp;</a>hug the plump little French girls at Chevalier&#8217;s dances, and
			sometimes, of a summer night, he even went across the dewy
			cornfields and through the wild-plum thicket to play the fiddle
			for Lena Hanson, whose name was a reproach through all
			the Divide country, where the women are usually too plain
			and too busy and too tired to depart from the ways of virtue.
			On such occasions Lena, attired in a pink wrapper and silk
			stockings and tiny pink slippers, would sing to him, accompanying
			herself on a battered guitar. It gave him a delicious
			sense of freedom and experience to be with a woman who, no
			matter how, had lived in big cities and knew the ways of
			town-folk, who had never worked in the fields and had kept
			her hands white and soft, her throat fair and tender, who had
			heard great singers in Denver and Salt Lake, and who knew
			the strange language of flattery and idleness and mirth.</p>

			<p>Yet, careless as he seemed, the frantic prayers of his mother
			were not altogether without their effect upon Eric. For days
			he had been fleeing before them as a criminal from his pursuers,
			and over his pleasures had fallen the shadow of something
			dark and terrible that dogged his steps. The harder he danced,
			the louder he sang, the more was he conscious that this phantom
			was gaining upon him, that in time it would track him
			down. One Sunday afternoon, late in the fall, when he had
			been drinking beer with Lena Hanson and listening to a song
			which made his cheeks burn, a rattlesnake had crawled out of
			the side of the sod house and thrust its ugly head in under the
			screen door. He was not afraid of snakes, but he knew
			enough of Gospellism to feel the significance of the reptile
			lying coiled there upon her doorstep. His lips were cold when
			he kissed Lena good-by, and he went there no more.</p>

			<p>The final barrier between Eric and his mother&#8217;s faith was
			his violin, and to that he clung as a man sometimes will cling
			to his dearest sin, to the weakness more precious to him than
			all his strength. In the great world beauty comes to men in
			many guises, and art in a hundred forms, but for Eric there
			was only his violin. It stood, to him, for all the manifestations
			of art; it was his only bridge into the kingdom of the soul.</p>

			<p>It was to Eric Hermannson that the evangelist directed his
			impassioned pleading that night.</p>

			<p>&#8220;<em>Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?</em> Is there a Saul here
			<a class="pagenum" id="page21" title="21">&nbsp;</a>to-night who has stopped his ears to that gentle pleading,
			who has thrust a spear into that bleeding side? Think of it, my
			brother; you are offered this wonderful love and you prefer
			the worm that dieth not and the fire which will not be
			quenched. What right have you to lose one of God&#8217;s precious
			souls? <em>Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?</em>&#8221;</p>

			<p>A great joy dawned in Asa Skinner&#8217;s pale face, for he saw
			that Eric Hermannson was swaying to and fro in his seat. The
			minister fell upon his knees and threw his long arms up over
			his head.</p>

			<p>&#8220;O my brothers! I feel it coming, the blessing we have
			prayed for. I tell you the Spirit is coming! Just a little more
			prayer, brothers, a little more zeal, and he will be here. I can
			feel his cooling wing upon my brow. Glory be to God forever
			and ever, amen!&#8221;</p>

			<p>The whole congregation groaned under the pressure of this
			spiritual panic. Shouts and hallelujahs went up from every lip.
			Another figure fell prostrate upon the floor. From the mourners&#8217;
			bench rose a chant of terror and rapture:</p>

			<blockquote class="poem">
				<p>&#8220;Eating honey and drinking wine,</p>
				<p class="i2"><em>Glory to the bleeding Lamb!</em></p>
				<p>I am my Lord&#8217;s and he is mine,</p>
				<p class="i2"><em>Glory to the bleeding Lamb!</em>&#8221;</p>
			</blockquote>

			<p>The hymn was sung in a dozen dialects and voiced all the
			vague yearning of these hungry lives, of these people who had
			starved all the passions so long, only to fall victims to the
			basest of them all, fear.</p>

			<p>A groan of ultimate anguish rose from Eric Hermannson&#8217;s
			bowed head, and the sound was like the groan of a great tree
			when it falls in the forest.</p>

			<p>The minister rose suddenly to his feet and threw back his
			head, crying in a loud voice:</p>

			<p>&#8220;<em>Lazarus, come forth!</em> Eric Hermannson, you are lost, going
			down at sea. In the name of God, and Jesus Christ his Son, I
			throw you the life-line. Take hold! Almighty God, my soul for
			his!&#8221; The minister threw his arms out and lifted his quivering
			face.</p>

			<p>Eric Hermannson rose to his feet; his lips were set and the
			<a class="pagenum" id="page22" title="22">&nbsp;</a>lightning was in his eyes. He took his violin by the neck and
			crushed it to splinters across his knee, and to Asa Skinner the
			sound was like the shackles of sin broken audibly asunder.</p>

			<h4>II.</h4>

			<p>For more than two years Eric Hermannson kept the austere
			faith to which he had sworn himself, kept it until a girl from
			the East came to spend a week on the Nebraska Divide. She
			was a girl of other manners and conditions, and there were
			greater distances between her life and Eric&#8217;s than all the miles
			which separated Rattlesnake Creek from New York city. Indeed,
			she had no business to be in the West at all; but ah!
			across what leagues of land and sea, by what improbable
			chances, do the unrelenting gods bring to us our fate!</p>

			<p>It was in a year of financial depression that Wyllis Elliot
			came to Nebraska to buy cheap land and revisit the country
			where he had spent a year of his youth. When he had graduated
			from Harvard it was still customary for moneyed gentlemen
			to send their scapegrace sons to rough it on ranches in
			the wilds of Nebraska or Dakota, or to consign them to a
			living death in the sage-brush of the Black Hills. These young
			men did not always return to the ways of civilized life. But
			Wyllis Elliot had not married a half-breed, nor been shot in a
			cow-punchers&#8217; brawl, nor wrecked by bad whisky, nor appropriated
			by a smirched adventuress. He had been saved from
			these things by a girl, his sister, who had been very near to his
			life ever since the days when they read fairy tales together and
			dreamed the dreams that never come true. On this, his first
			visit to his father&#8217;s ranch since he left it six years before, he
			brought her with him. She had been laid up half the winter
			from a sprain received while skating, and had had too much
			time for reflection during those months. She was restless and
			filled with a desire to see something of the wild country of
			which her brother had told her so much. She was to be married
			the next winter, and Wyllis understood her when she
			begged him to take her with him on this long, aimless jaunt
			across the continent, to taste the last of their freedom together.
			It comes to all women of her type&#8212;that desire to
			<a class="pagenum" id="page23" title="23">&nbsp;</a>taste the unknown which allures and terrifies, to run one&#8217;s
			whole soul&#8217;s length out to the wind&#8212;just once.</p>

			<p>It had been an eventful journey. Wyllis somehow understood
			that strain of gypsy blood in his sister, and he knew
			where to take her. They had slept in sod houses on the
			Platte River, made the acquaintance of the personnel of a
			third-rate opera company on the train to Deadwood, dined in
			a camp of railroad constructors at the world&#8217;s end beyond
			New Castle, gone through the Black Hills on horseback,
			fished for trout in Dome Lake, watched a dance at Cripple
			Creek, where the lost souls who hide in the hills gathered for
			their besotted revelry. And now, last of all, before the return
			to thraldom, there was this little shack, anchored on the
			windy crest of the Divide, a little black dot against the flaming
			sunsets, a scented sea of cornland bathed in opalescent air
			and blinding sunlight.</p>

			<p>Margaret Elliot was one of those women of whom there
			are so many in this day, when old order, passing, giveth place
			to new; beautiful, talented, critical, unsatisfied, tired of the
			world at twenty-four. For the moment the life and people of
			the Divide interested her. She was there but a week; perhaps
			had she stayed longer, that inexorable ennui which travels
			faster even than the Vestibule Limited would have overtaken
			her. The week she tarried there was the week that Eric Hermannson
			was helping Jerry Lockhart thresh; a week earlier or
			a week later, and there would have been no story to write.</p>

			<p>It was on Thursday and they were to leave on Saturday.
			Wyllis and his sister were sitting on the wide piazza of the
			ranchhouse, staring out into the afternoon sunlight and protesting
			against the gusts of hot wind that blew up from the
			sandy river-bottom twenty miles to the southward.</p>

			<p>The young man pulled his cap lower over his eyes and remarked:</p>

			<p>&#8220;This wind is the real thing; you don&#8217;t strike it anywhere
			else. You remember we had a touch of it in Algiers and I told
			you it came from Kansas. It&#8217;s the key-note of this country.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Wyllis touched her hand that lay on the hammock and continued
			gently:</p>

			<p>&#8220;I hope it&#8217;s paid you, Sis. Roughing it&#8217;s dangerous business;
			it takes the taste out of things.&#8221;</p>

			<p><a class="pagenum" id="page24" title="24">&nbsp;</a>She shut her fingers firmly over the brown hand that was so
			like her own.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Paid? Why, Wyllis, I haven&#8217;t been so happy since we were
			children and were going to discover the ruins of Troy together
			some day. Do you know, I believe I could just stay on
			here forever and let the world go on its own gait. It seems as
			though the tension and strain we used to talk of last winter
			were gone for good, as though one could never give one&#8217;s
			strength out to such petty things any more.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Wyllis brushed the ashes of his pipe away from the silk
			handkerchief that was knotted about his neck and stared
			moodily off at the sky-line.</p>

			<p>&#8220;No, you&#8217;re mistaken. This would bore you after a while.
			You can&#8217;t shake the fever of the other life. I&#8217;ve tried it. There
			was a time when the gay fellows of Rome could trot down
			into the Thebaid and burrow into the sandhills and get rid of
			it. But it&#8217;s all too complex now. You see we&#8217;ve made our dissipations
			so dainty and respectable that they&#8217;ve gone further
			in than the flesh, and taken hold of the ego proper. You
			couldn&#8217;t rest, even here. The war-cry would follow you.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t waste words, Wyllis, but you never miss fire. I
			talk more than you do, without saying half so much. You
			must have learned the art of silence from these taciturn Norwegians.
			I think I like silent men.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;Naturally,&#8221; said Wyllis, &#8220;since you have decided to marry
			the most brilliant talker you know.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Both were silent for a time, listening to the sighing of the
			hot wind through the parched morning-glory vines. Margaret
			spoke first.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Tell me, Wyllis, were many of the Norwegians you used to
			know as interesting as Eric Hermannson?&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;Who, Siegfried? Well, no. He used to be the flower of the
			Norwegian youth in my day, and he&#8217;s rather an exception,
			even now. He has retrograded, though. The bonds of the soil
			have tightened on him, I fancy.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;Siegfried? Come, that&#8217;s rather good, Wyllis. He looks like
			a dragon-slayer. What is it that makes him so different from
			the others? I can talk to him; he seems quite like a human
			being.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Wyllis, meditatively, &#8220;I don&#8217;t read Bourget as
			<a class="pagenum" id="page25" title="25">&nbsp;</a>much as my cultured sister, and I&#8217;m not so well up in analysis,
			but I fancy it&#8217;s because one keeps cherishing a perfectly unwarranted
			suspicion that under that big, hulking anatomy of
			his, he may conceal a soul somewhere. Nicht wahr?&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;Something like that,&#8221; said Margaret, thoughtfully, &#8220;except
			that it&#8217;s more than a suspicion, and it isn&#8217;t groundless. He has
			one, and he makes it known, somehow, without speaking.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;I always have my doubts about loquacious souls,&#8221; Wyllis
			remarked, with the unbelieving smile that had grown habitual
			with him.</p>

			<p>Margaret went on, not heeding the interruption. &#8220;I knew it
			from the first, when he told me about the suicide of his
			cousin, the Bernstein boy. That kind of blunt pathos can&#8217;t be
			summoned at will in anybody. The earlier novelists rose to it,
			sometimes, unconsciously. But last night when I sang for him
			I was doubly sure. Oh, I haven&#8217;t told you about that yet!
			Better light your pipe again. You see, he stumbled in on me in
			the dark when I was pumping away at that old parlor organ
			to please Mrs. Lockhart. It&#8217;s her household fetish and I&#8217;ve
			forgotten how many pounds of butter she made and sold to
			buy it. Well, Eric stumbled in, and in some inarticulate manner
			made me understand that he wanted me to sing for him. I
			sang just the old things, of course. It&#8217;s queer to sing familiar
			things here at the world&#8217;s end. It makes one think how the
			hearts of men have carried them around the world, into the
			wastes of Iceland and the jungles of Africa and the islands of
			the Pacific. I think if one lived here long enough one would
			quite forget how to be trivial, and would read only the great
			books that we never get time to read in the world, and would
			remember only the great music, and the things that are really
			worth while would stand out clearly against that horizon over
			there. And of course I played the intermezzo from &#8216;Cavalleria
			Rusticana&#8217; for him; it goes rather better on an organ than
			most things do. He shuffled his feet and twisted his big hands
			up into knots and blurted out that he didn&#8217;t know there was
			any music like that in the world. Why, there were tears in his
			voice, Wyllis! Yes, like Rossetti, I <em>heard</em> his tears. Then it
			dawned upon me that it was probably the first good music he
			had ever heard in all his life. Think of it, to care for music as
			he does and never to hear it, never to know that it exists on
			<a class="pagenum" id="page26" title="26">&nbsp;</a>earth! To long for it as we long for other perfect experiences
			that never come. I can&#8217;t tell you what music means to that
			man. I never saw any one so susceptible to it. It gave
			him speech, he became alive. When I had finished the intermezzo,
			he began telling me about a little crippled brother
			who died and whom he loved and used to carry everywhere
			in his arms. He did not wait for encouragement. He took
			up the story and told it slowly, as if to himself, just sort of
			rose up and told his own woe to answer Mascagni&#8217;s. It overcame
			me.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;Poor devil,&#8221; said Wyllis, looking at her with mysterious
			eyes, &#8220;and so you&#8217;ve given him a new woe. Now he&#8217;ll go on
			wanting Grieg and Schubert the rest of his days and never
			getting them. That&#8217;s a girl&#8217;s philanthropy for you!&#8221;</p>

			<p>Jerry Lockhart came out of the house screwing his chin
			over the unusual luxury of a stiff white collar, which his wife
			insisted upon as a necessary article of toilet while Miss Elliot
			was at the house. Jerry sat down on the step and smiled his
			broad, red smile at Margaret.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ve got the music for your dance, Miss Elliot. Olaf
			Oleson will bring his accordion and Mollie will play the organ,
			when she isn&#8217;t lookin&#8217; after the grub, and a little chap
			from Frenchtown will bring his fiddle&#8212;though the French
			don&#8217;t mix with the Norwegians much.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;Delightful! Mr. Lockhart, that dance will be the feature
			of our trip, and it&#8217;s so nice of you to get it up for us. We&#8217;ll
			see the Norwegians in character at last,&#8221; cried Margaret,
			cordially.</p>

			<p>&#8220;See here, Lockhart, I&#8217;ll settle with you for backing her in
			this scheme,&#8221; said Wyllis, sitting up and knocking the ashes
			out of his pipe. &#8220;She&#8217;s done crazy things enough on this trip,
			but to talk of dancing all night with a gang of half-mad Norwegians
			and taking the carriage at four to catch the six o&#8217;clock
			train out of Riverton&#8212;well, it&#8217;s tommy-rot, that&#8217;s what
			it is!&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;Wyllis, I leave it to your sovereign power of reason to
			decide whether it isn&#8217;t easier to stay up all night than to get
			up at three in the morning. To get up at three, think what
			that means! No, sir, I prefer to keep my vigil and then get
			into a sleeper.&#8221;</p>

			<p><a class="pagenum" id="page27" title="27">&nbsp;</a>&#8220;But what do you want with the Norwegians? I thought
			you were tired of dancing.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;So I am, with some people. But I want to see a Norwegian
			dance, and I intend to. Come, Wyllis, you know how
			seldom it is that one really wants to do anything nowadays. I
			wonder when I have really wanted to go to a party before. It
			will be something to remember next month at Newport,
			when we have to and don&#8217;t want to. Remember your own
			theory that contrast is about the only thing that makes life
			endurable. This is my party and Mr. Lockhart&#8217;s; your whole
			duty to-morrow night will consist in being nice to the Norwegian
			girls. I&#8217;ll warrant you were adept enough at it once.
			And you&#8217;d better be very nice indeed, for if there are many
			such young valkyrs as Eric&#8217;s sister among them, they would
			simply tie you up in a knot if they suspected you were guying
			them.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Wyllis groaned and sank back into the hammock to consider
			his fate, while his sister went on.</p>

			<p>&#8220;And the guests, Mr. Lockhart, did they accept?&#8221;</p>

			<p>Lockhart took out his knife and began sharpening it on the
			sole of his plowshoe.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Well, I guess we&#8217;ll have a couple dozen. You see it&#8217;s pretty
			hard to get a crowd together here any more. Most of &#8217;em
			have gone over to the Free Gospellers, and they&#8217;d rather put
			their feet in the fire than shake &#8217;em to a fiddle.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Margaret made a gesture of impatience.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Those Free Gospellers have just cast an evil spell over this
			country, haven&#8217;t they?&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Lockhart, cautiously, &#8220;I don&#8217;t just like to pass
			judgment on any Christian sect, but if you&#8217;re to know the
			chosen by their works, the Gospellers can&#8217;t make a very proud
			showin&#8217;, an&#8217; that&#8217;s a fact. They&#8217;re responsible for a few suicides,
			and they&#8217;ve sent a good-sized delegation to the state
			insane asylum, an&#8217; I don&#8217;t see as they&#8217;ve made the rest of us
			much better than we were before. I had a little herdboy last
			spring, as square a little Dane as I want to work for me, but
			after the Gospellers got hold of him and sanctified him, the
			little beggar used to get down on his knees out on the prairie
			and pray by the hour and let the cattle get into the corn, an&#8217; I
			had to fire him. That&#8217;s about the way it goes. Now there&#8217;s
			<a class="pagenum" id="page28" title="28">&nbsp;</a>Eric; that chap used to be a hustler and the spryest dancer in
			all this section&#8212;called all the dances. Now he&#8217;s got no ambition
			and he&#8217;s glum as a preacher. I don&#8217;t suppose we can even
			get him to come in to-morrow night.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;Eric? Why, he must dance, we can&#8217;t let him off,&#8221; said Margaret,
			quickly. &#8220;Why, I intend to dance with him myself!&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid he won&#8217;t dance. I asked him this morning if
			he&#8217;d help us out and he said, &#8216;I don&#8217;t dance now, any more,&#8217;&#8221;
			said Lockhart, imitating the labored English of the Norwegian.</p>

			<p>&#8220;&#8216;The Miller of Hoffbau, the Miller of Hoffbau, O my
			Princess!&#8217;&#8221; chirped Wyllis, cheerfully, from his hammock.</p>

			<p>The red on his sister&#8217;s cheek deepened a little, and she
			laughed mischievously. &#8220;We&#8217;ll see about that, sir. I&#8217;ll not admit
			that I am beaten until I have asked him myself.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Every night Eric rode over to St. Anne, a little village
			in the heart of the French settlement, for the mail. As the
			road lay through the most attractive part of the Divide country,
			on several occasions Margaret Elliot and her brother
			had accompanied him. To-night Wyllis had business with
			Lockhart, and Margaret rode with Eric, mounted on a
			frisky little mustang that Mrs. Lockhart had broken to the
			side-saddle. Margaret regarded her escort very much as she
			did the servant who always accompanied her on long rides
			at home, and the ride to the village was a silent one. She
			was occupied with thoughts of another world, and Eric was
			wrestling with more thoughts than had ever been crowded
			into his head before. He rode with his eyes riveted on that
			slight figure before him, as though he wished to absorb it
			through the optic nerves and hold it in his brain forever.
			He understood the situation perfectly. His brain worked
			slowly, but he had a keen sense of the values of things. This
			girl represented an entirely new species of humanity to him,
			but he knew where to place her. The prophets of old, when
			an angel first appeared unto them, never doubted its high
			origin.</p>

			<p>Eric was patient under the adverse conditions of his life,
			but he was not servile. The Norse blood in him had not entirely
			lost its self-reliance. He came of a proud fisher line, men
			who were not afraid of anything but the ice and the devil, and
			<a class="pagenum" id="page29" title="29">&nbsp;</a>he had prospects before him when his father went down off
			the North Cape in the long Arctic night, and his mother,
			seized by a violent horror of seafaring life, had followed her
			brother to America. Eric was eighteen then, handsome as
			young Siegfried, a giant in stature, with a skin singularly pure
			and delicate, like a Swede&#8217;s; hair as yellow as the locks of
			Tennyson&#8217;s amorous Prince, and eyes of a fierce, burning blue,
			whose flash was most dangerous to women. He had in those
			days a certain pride of bearing, a certain confidence of approach,
			that usually accompanies physical perfection. It was
			even said of him then that he was in love with life, and inclined
			to levity, a vice most unusual on the Divide. But the
			sad history of those Norwegian exiles, transplanted in an arid
			soil and under a scorching sun, had repeated itself in his case.
			Toil and isolation had sobered him, and he grew more and
			more like the clods among which he labored. It was as though
			some red-hot instrument had touched for a moment those
			delicate fibers of the brain which respond to acute pain or
			pleasure, in which lies the power of exquisite sensation, and
			had seared them quite away. It is a painful thing to watch the
			light die out of the eyes of those Norsemen, leaving an expression
			of impenetrable sadness, quite passive, quite hopeless,
			a shadow that is never lifted. With some this change
			comes almost at once, in the first bitterness of homesickness,
			with others it comes more slowly, according to the time it
			takes each man&#8217;s heart to die.</p>

			<p>Oh, those poor Northmen of the Divide! They are dead
			many a year before they are put to rest in the little graveyard
			on the windy hill where exiles of all nations grow akin.</p>

			<p>The peculiar species of hypochondria to which the exiles of
			his people sooner or later succumb had not developed in Eric
			until that night at the Lone Star schoolhouse, when he had
			broken his violin across his knee. After that, the gloom of his
			people settled down upon him, and the gospel of maceration
			began its work. &#8220;<em>If thine eye offend thee, pluck it out</em>,&#8221; et cetera.
			The pagan smile that once hovered about his lips was gone,
			and he was one with sorrow. Religion heals a hundred hearts
			for one that it embitters, but when it destroys, its work is
			quick and deadly, and where the agony of the cross has been,
			joy will not come again. This man understood things literally:
			<a class="pagenum" id="page30" title="30">&nbsp;</a>one must live without pleasure to die without fear; to save the
			soul it was necessary to starve the soul.</p>

			<p>The sun hung low above the cornfields when Margaret and
			her cavalier left St. Anne. South of the town there is a stretch
			of road that runs for some three miles through the French
			settlement, where the prairie is as level as the surface of a lake.
			There the fields of flax and wheat and rye are bordered by
			precise rows of slender, tapering Lombard poplars. It was a
			yellow world that Margaret Elliot saw under the wide light of
			the setting sun.</p>

			<p>The girl gathered up her reins and called back to Eric, &#8220;It
			will be safe to run the horses here, won&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;Yes, I think so, now,&#8221; he answered, touching his spur to
			his pony&#8217;s flank. They were off like the wind. It is an old
			saying in the West that new-comers always ride a horse or
			two to death before they get broken in to the country. They
			are tempted by the great open spaces and try to outride the
			horizon, to get to the end of something. Margaret galloped
			over the level road, and Eric, from behind, saw her long veil
			fluttering in the wind. It had fluttered just so in his dreams
			last night and the night before. With a sudden inspiration of
			courage he overtook her and rode beside her, looking intently
			at her half-averted face. Before, he had only stolen occasional
			glances at it, seen it in blinding flashes, always with
			more or less embarrassment, but now he determined to let
			every line of it sink into his memory. Men of the world
			would have said that it was an unusual face, nervous, finely
			cut, with clear, elegant lines that betokened ancestry. Men of
			letters would have called it a historic face, and would have
			conjectured at what old passions, long asleep, what old sorrows
			forgotten time out of mind, doing battle together in
			ages gone, had curved those delicate nostrils, left their unconscious
			memory in those eyes. But Eric read no meaning
			in these details. To him this beauty was something more
			than color and line; it was as a flash of white light, in which
			one cannot distinguish color because all colors are there. To
			him it was a complete revelation, an embodiment of those
			dreams of impossible loveliness that linger by a young man&#8217;s
			pillow on midsummer nights; yet, because it held something
			more than the attraction of health and youth and shapeliness,
			<a class="pagenum" id="page31" title="31">&nbsp;</a>it troubled him, and in its presence he felt as the Goths
			before the white marbles in the Roman Capitol, not knowing
			whether they were men or gods. At times he felt like uncovering
			his head before it, again the fury seized him to
			break and despoil, to find the clay in this spirit-thing and
			stamp upon it. Away from her, he longed to strike out with
			his arms, and take and hold; it maddened him that this
			woman whom he could break in his hands should be so
			much stronger than he. But near her, he never questioned
			this strength; he admitted its potentiality as he admitted the
			miracles of the Bible; it enervated and conquered him. To-night,
			when he rode so close to her that he could have
			touched her, he knew that he might as well reach out his
			hand to take a star.</p>

			<p>Margaret stirred uneasily under his gaze and turned questioningly
			in her saddle.</p>

			<p>&#8220;This wind puts me a little out of breath when we ride
			fast,&#8221; she said.</p>

			<p>Eric turned his eyes away.</p>

			<p>&#8220;I want to ask you if I go to New York to work, if I maybe
			hear music like you sang last night? I been a purty good hand
			to work,&#8221; he asked, timidly.</p>

			<p>Margaret looked at him with surprise, and then, as she
			studied the outline of his face, pityingly.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Well, you might&#8212;but you&#8217;d lose a good deal else. I
			shouldn&#8217;t like you to go to New York&#8212;and be poor, you&#8217;d
			be out of atmosphere, some way,&#8221; she said, slowly. Inwardly
			she was thinking: &#8220;There he would be altogether sordid,
			impossible&#8212;a machine who would carry one&#8217;s trunks upstairs,
			perhaps. Here he is every inch a man, rather picturesque;
			why is it?&#8221; &#8220;No,&#8221; she added aloud, &#8220;I shouldn&#8217;t like
			that.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;Then I not go,&#8221; said Eric, decidedly.</p>

			<p>Margaret turned her face to hide a smile. She was a trifle
			amused and a trifle annoyed. Suddenly she spoke again.</p>

			<p>&#8220;But I&#8217;ll tell you what I do want you to do, Eric. I want
			you to dance with us to-morrow night and teach me some of
			the Norwegian dances; they say you know them all. Won&#8217;t
			you?&#8221;</p>

			<p>Eric straightened himself in his saddle and his eyes flashed
			<a class="pagenum" id="page32" title="32">&nbsp;</a>as they had done in the Lone Star schoolhouse when he broke
			his violin across his knee.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Yes, I will,&#8221; he said, quietly, and he believed that he delivered
			his soul to hell as he said it.</p>

			<p>They had reached the rougher country now, where the
			road wound through a narrow cut in one of the bluffs along
			the creek, when a beat of hoofs ahead and the sharp neighing
			of horses made the ponies start and Eric rose in his stirrups.
			Then down the gulch in front of them and over the steep clay
			banks thundered a herd of wild ponies, nimble as monkeys
			and wild as rabbits, such as horse-traders drive east from the
			plains of Montana to sell in the farming country. Margaret&#8217;s
			pony made a shrill sound, a neigh that was almost a scream,
			and started up the clay bank to meet them, all the wild blood
			of the range breaking out in an instant. Margaret called to
			Eric just as he threw himself out of the saddle and caught her
			pony&#8217;s bit. But the wiry little animal had gone mad and was
			kicking and biting like a devil. Her wild brothers of the range
			were all about her, neighing, and pawing the earth, and striking
			her with their fore feet and snapping at her flanks. It was
			the old liberty of the range that the little beast fought for.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Drop the reins and hold tight, tight!&#8221; Eric called, throwing
			all his weight upon the bit, struggling under those frantic
			fore feet that now beat at his breast, and now kicked at the
			wild mustangs that surged and tossed about him. He succeeded
			in wrenching the pony&#8217;s head toward him and crowding
			her withers against the clay bank, so that she could not
			roll.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Hold tight, tight!&#8221; he shouted again, launching a kick at
			a snorting animal that reared back against Margaret&#8217;s saddle.
			If she should lose her courage and fall now, under those
			hoofs&#8212;&#8212;He struck out again and again, kicking right and
			left with all his might. Already the negligent drivers had galloped
			into the cut, and their long quirts were whistling over
			the heads of the herd. As suddenly as it had come, the struggling,
			frantic wave of wild life swept up out of the gulch and
			on across the open prairie, and with a long despairing whinny
			of farewell the pony dropped her head and stood trembling in
			her sweat, shaking the foam and blood from her bit.</p>

			<p>Eric stepped close to Margaret&#8217;s side and laid his hand on
			<a class="pagenum" id="page33" title="33">&nbsp;</a>her saddle. &#8220;You are not hurt?&#8221; he asked, hoarsely. As he
			raised his face in the soft starlight she saw that it was white
			and drawn and that his lips were working nervously.</p>

			<p>&#8220;No, no, not at all. But you, you are suffering; they struck
			you!&#8221; she cried in sharp alarm.</p>

			<p>He stepped back and drew his hand across his brow.</p>

			<p>&#8220;No, it is not that,&#8221; he spoke rapidly now, with his hands
			clenched at his side. &#8220;But if they had hurt you, I would beat
			their brains out with my hands, I would kill them all. I was
			never afraid before. You are the only beautiful thing that has
			ever come close to me. You came like an angel out of the sky.
			You are like the music you sing, you are like the stars and the
			snow on the mountains where I played when I was a little
			boy. You are like all that I wanted once and never had, you
			are all that they have killed in me. I die for you to-night,
			to-morrow, for all eternity. I am not a coward; I was afraid
			because I love you more than Christ who died for me, more
			than I am afraid of hell, or hope for heaven. I was never afraid
			before. If you had fallen&#8212;oh, my God!&#8221; he threw his arms
			out blindly and dropped his head upon the pony&#8217;s mane,
			leaning limply against the animal like a man struck by some
			sickness. His shoulders rose and fell perceptibly with his
			labored breathing. The horse stood cowed with exhaustion
			and fear. Presently Margaret laid her hand on Eric&#8217;s head and
			said gently:</p>

			<p>&#8220;You are better now, shall we go on? Can you get your
			horse?&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;No, he has gone with the herd. I will lead yours, she is not
			safe. I will not frighten you again.&#8221; His voice was still husky,
			but it was steady now. He took hold of the bit and tramped
			home in silence.</p>

			<p>When they reached the house, Eric stood stolidly by the
			pony&#8217;s head until Wyllis came to lift his sister from the saddle.</p>

			<p>&#8220;The horses were badly frightened, Wyllis. I think I was
			pretty thoroughly scared myself,&#8221; she said as she took her
			brother&#8217;s arm and went slowly up the hill toward the house.
			&#8220;No, I&#8217;m not hurt, thanks to Eric. You must thank him for
			taking such good care of me. He&#8217;s a mighty fine fellow. I&#8217;ll
			tell you all about it in the morning, dear. I was pretty well
			shaken up and I&#8217;m going right to bed now. Good-night.&#8221;</p>

			<p><a class="pagenum" id="page34" title="34">&nbsp;</a>When she reached the low room in which she slept, she
			sank upon the bed in her riding-dress face downward.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Oh, I pity him! I pity him!&#8221; she murmured, with a long
			sigh of exhaustion. She must have slept a little. When she rose
			again, she took from her dress a letter that had been waiting
			for her at the village post-office. It was closely written in a
			long, angular hand, covering a dozen pages of foreign note-paper,
			and began:&#8212;</p>

			<p>&#8220;My Dearest Margaret: If I should attempt to say <em>how like a
			winter hath thine absence been</em>, I should incur the risk of being
			tedious. Really, it takes the sparkle out of everything. Having
			nothing better to do, and not caring to go anywhere in
			particular without you, I remained in the city until Jack
			Courtwell noted my general despondency and brought me
			down here to his place on the sound to manage some open-air
			theatricals he is getting up. &#8216;As You Like It&#8217; is of course
			the piece selected. Miss Harrison plays Rosalind. I wish you
			had been here to take the part. Miss Harrison reads her lines
			well, but she is either a maiden-all-forlorn or a tomboy; insists
			on reading into the part all sorts of deeper meanings and
			highly colored suggestions wholly out of harmony with the
			pastoral setting. Like most of the professionals, she exaggerates
			the emotional element and quite fails to do justice to
			Rosalind&#8217;s facile wit and really brilliant mental qualities.
			Gerard will do Orlando, but rumor says he is épris of your
			sometime friend, Miss Meredith, and his memory is treacherous
			and his interest fitful.</p>

			<p>&#8220;My new pictures arrived last week on the &#8216;Gascogne.&#8217; The
			Puvis de Chavannes is even more beautiful than I thought it
			in Paris. A pale dream-maiden sits by a pale dream-cow, and a
			stream of anemic water flows at her feet. The Constant, you
			will remember, I got because you admired it. It is here in all
			its florid splendor, the whole dominated by a glowing sensuosity.
			The drapery of the female figure is as wonderful as you
			said; the fabric all barbaric pearl and gold, painted with an
			easy, effortless voluptuousness, and that white, gleaming line
			of African coast in the background recalls memories of you
			very precious to me. But it is useless to deny that Constant
			irritates me. Though I cannot prove the charge against him,
			his brilliancy always makes me suspect him of cheapness.&#8221;</p>

			<p><a class="pagenum" id="page35" title="35">&nbsp;</a>Here Margaret stopped and glanced at the remaining pages
			of this strange love-letter. They seemed to be filled chiefly
			with discussions of pictures and books, and with a slow smile
			she laid them by.</p>

			<p>She rose and began undressing. Before she lay down she
			went to open the window. With her hand on the sill, she
			hesitated, feeling suddenly as though some danger were lurking
			outside, some inordinate desire waiting to spring upon
			her in the darkness. She stood there for a long time, gazing at
			the infinite sweep of the sky.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Oh, it is all so little, so little there,&#8221; she murmured.
			&#8220;When everything else is so dwarfed, why should one expect
			love to be great? Why should one try to read highly colored
			suggestions into a life like that? If only I could find one thing
			in it all that mattered greatly, one thing that would warm
			me when I am alone! Will life never give me that one great
			moment?&#8221;</p>

			<p>As she raised the window, she heard a sound in the plum-bushes
			outside. It was only the house-dog roused from his
			sleep, but Margaret started violently and trembled so that she
			caught the foot of the bed for support. Again she felt herself
			pursued by some overwhelming longing, some desperate necessity
			for herself, like the outstretching of helpless, unseen
			arms in the darkness, and the air seemed heavy with sighs of
			yearning. She fled to her bed with the words, &#8220;I love you
			more than Christ, who died for me!&#8221; ringing in her ears.</p>

			<h4>III.</h4>

			<p>About midnight the dance at Lockhart&#8217;s was at its height.
			Even the old men who had come to &#8220;look on&#8221; caught the
			spirit of revelry and stamped the floor with the vigor of old
			Silenus. Eric took the violin from the Frenchman, and Minna
			Oleson sat at the organ, and the music grew more and more
			characteristic&#8212;rude, half-mournful music, made up of the
			folk-songs of the North, that the villagers sing through the
			long night in hamlets by the sea, when they are thinking of
			the sun, and the spring, and the fishermen so long away. To
			Margaret some of it sounded like Grieg&#8217;s Peer Gynt music.
			She found something irresistibly infectious in the mirth of
			<a class="pagenum" id="page36" title="36">&nbsp;</a>these people who were so seldom merry, and she felt almost
			one of them. Something seemed struggling for freedom in
			them to-night, something of the joyous childhood of the nations
			which exile had not killed. The girls were all boisterous
			with delight. Pleasure came to them but rarely, and when it
			came, they caught at it wildly and crushed its fluttering wings
			in their strong brown fingers. They had a hard life enough,
			most of them. Torrid summers and freezing winters, labor and
			drudgery and ignorance, were the portion of their girlhood; a
			short wooing, a hasty, loveless marriage, unlimited maternity,
			thankless sons, premature age and ugliness, were the dower of
			their womanhood. But what matter? To-night there was hot
			liquor in the glass and hot blood in the heart; to-night they
			danced.</p>

			<p>To-night Eric Hermannson had renewed his youth. He was
			no longer the big, silent Norwegian who had sat at Margaret&#8217;s
			feet and looked hopelessly into her eyes. To-night he
			was a man, with a man&#8217;s rights and a man&#8217;s power. To-night
			he was Siegfried indeed. His hair was yellow as the heavy
			wheat in the ripe of summer, and his eyes flashed like the blue
			water between the ice-packs in the North Seas. He was not
			afraid of Margaret to-night, and when he danced with her he
			held her firmly. She was tired and dragged on his arm a little,
			but the strength of the man was like an all-pervading fluid,
			stealing through her veins, awakening under her heart some
			nameless, unsuspected existence that had slumbered there all
			these years and that went out through her throbbing fingertips
			to his that answered. She wondered if the hoydenish
			blood of some lawless ancestor, long asleep, were calling out
			in her to-night, some drop of a hotter fluid that the centuries
			had failed to cool, and why, if this curse were in her, it had
			not spoken before. But was it a curse, this awakening, this
			wealth before undiscovered, this music set free? For the first
			time in her life her heart held something stronger than herself,
			was not this worth while? Then she ceased to wonder.
			She lost sight of the lights and the faces, and the music was
			drowned by the beating of her own arteries. She saw only the
			blue eyes that flashed above her, felt only the warmth of that
			throbbing hand which held hers and which the blood of his
			heart fed. Dimly, as in a dream, she saw the drooping shoulders,
			<a class="pagenum" id="page37" title="37">&nbsp;</a>high white forehead and tight, cynical mouth of the man
			she was to marry in December. For an hour she had been
			crowding back the memory of that face with all her strength.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Let us stop, this is enough,&#8221; she whispered. His only
			answer was to tighten the arm behind her. She sighed and let
			that masterful strength bear her where it would. She forgot
			that this man was little more than a savage, that they would
			part at dawn. The blood has no memories, no reflections, no
			regrets for the past, no consideration of the future.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Let us go out where it is cooler,&#8221; she said when the music
			stopped; thinking, &#8220;I am growing faint here, I shall be all
			right in the open air.&#8221; They stepped out into the cool, blue air
			of the night.</p>

			<p>Since the older folk had begun dancing, the young Norwegians
			had been slipping out in couples to climb the windmill
			tower into the cooler atmosphere, as is their custom.</p>

			<p>&#8220;You like to go up?&#8221; asked Eric, close to her ear.</p>

			<p>She turned and looked at him with suppressed amusement.
			&#8220;How high is it?&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;Forty feet, about. I not let you fall.&#8221; There was a note of
			irresistible pleading in his voice, and she felt that he tremendously
			wished her to go. Well, why not? This was a night of
			the unusual, when she was not herself at all, but was living an
			unreality. To-morrow, yes, in a few hours, there would be the
			Vestibule Limited and the world.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Well, if you&#8217;ll take good care of me. I used to be able to
			climb, when I was a little girl.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Once at the top and seated on the platform, they were silent.
			Margaret wondered if she would not hunger for that
			scene all her life, through all the routine of the days to come.
			Above them stretched the great Western sky, serenely blue,
			even in the night, with its big, burning stars, never so cold
			and dead and far away as in denser atmospheres. The moon
			would not be up for twenty minutes yet, and all about the
			horizon, that wide horizon, which seemed to reach around
			the world, lingered a pale, white light, as of a universal dawn.
			The weary wind brought up to them the heavy odors of the
			cornfields. The music of the dance sounded faintly from below.
			Eric leaned on his elbow beside her, his legs swinging
			down on the ladder. His great shoulders looked more than
			<a class="pagenum" id="page38" title="38">&nbsp;</a>ever like those of the stone Doryphorus, who stands in his
			perfect, reposeful strength in the Louvre, and had often made
			her wonder if such men died forever with the youth of
			Greece.</p>

			<p>&#8220;How sweet the corn smells at night,&#8221; said Margaret nervously.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Yes, like the flowers that grow in paradise, I think.&#8221;</p>

			<p>She was somewhat startled by this reply, and more startled
			when this taciturn man spoke again.</p>

			<p>&#8220;You go away to-morrow?&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;Yes, we have stayed longer than we thought to now.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;You not come back any more?&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;No, I expect not. You see, it is a long trip; half-way across
			the continent.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;You soon forget about this country, I guess.&#8221; It seemed to
			him now a little thing to lose his soul for this woman, but
			that she should utterly forget this night into which he threw
			all his life and all his eternity, that was a bitter thought.</p>

			<p>&#8220;No, Eric, I will not forget. You have all been too kind to
			me for that. And you won&#8217;t be sorry you danced this one
			night, will you?&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;I never be sorry. I have not been so happy before. I not be
			so happy again, ever. You will be happy many nights yet, I
			only this one. I will dream sometimes, maybe.&#8221;</p>

			<p>The mighty resignation of his tone alarmed and touched
			her. It was as when some great animal composes itself for
			death, as when a great ship goes down at sea.</p>

			<p>She sighed, but did not answer him. He drew a little closer
			and looked into her eyes.</p>

			<p>&#8220;You are not always happy, too?&#8221; he asked.</p>

			<p>&#8220;No, not always, Eric; not very often, I think.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;You have a trouble?&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;Yes, but I cannot put it into words. Perhaps if I could do
			that, I could cure it.&#8221;</p>

			<p>He clasped his hands together over his heart, as children do
			when they pray, and said falteringly, &#8220;If I own all the world, I
			give him you.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Margaret felt a sudden moisture in her eyes, and laid her
			hand on his.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Thank you, Eric; I believe you would. But perhaps even
			<a class="pagenum" id="page39" title="39">&nbsp;</a>then I should not be happy. Perhaps I have too much of it
			already.&#8221;</p>

			<p>She did not take her hand away from him; she did not
			dare. She sat still and waited for the traditions in which she
			had always believed to speak and save her. But they were
			dumb. She belonged to an ultra-refined civilization which
			tries to cheat nature with elegant sophistries. Cheat nature?
			Bah! One generation may do it, perhaps two, but the
			third&#8212;&#8212; Can we ever rise above nature or sink below her?
			Did she not turn on Jerusalem as upon Sodom, upon St. Anthony
			in his desert as upon Nero in his seraglio? Does she not
			always cry in brutal triumph: &#8220;I am here still, at the bottom of
			things, warming the roots of life; you cannot starve me nor
			tame me nor thwart me; I made the world, I rule it, and I am
			its destiny.&#8221;</p>

			<p>This woman, on a windmill tower at the world&#8217;s end with a
			giant barbarian, heard that cry to-night, and she was afraid!
			Ah! the terror and the delight of that moment when first we
			fear ourselves! Until then we have not lived.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Come, Eric, let us go down; the moon is up and the music
			has begun again,&#8221; she said.</p>

			<p>He rose silently and stepped down upon the ladder, putting
			his arm about her to help her. That arm could have thrown
			Thor&#8217;s hammer out in the cornfields yonder, yet it scarcely
			touched her, and his hand trembled as it had done in the
			dance. His face was level with hers now and the moonlight
			fell sharply upon it. All her life she had searched the faces of
			men for the look that lay in his eyes. She knew that that look
			had never shone for her before, would never shine for her on
			earth again, that such love comes to one only in dreams or in
			impossible places like this, unattainable always. This was
			Love&#8217;s self, in a moment it would die. Stung by the agonized
			appeal that emanated from the man&#8217;s whole being, she leaned
			forward and laid her lips on his. Once, twice and again she
			heard the deep respirations rattle in his throat while she held
			them there, and the riotous force under her heart became an
			engulfing weakness. He drew her up to him until he felt all
			the resistance go out of her body, until every nerve relaxed
			and yielded. When she drew her face back from his, it was
			white with fear.</p>

			<p><a class="pagenum" id="page40" title="40">&nbsp;</a>&#8220;Let us go down, oh, my God! let us go down!&#8221; she
			muttered. And the drunken stars up yonder seemed reeling
			to some appointed doom as she clung to the rounds of the
			ladder. All that she was to know of love she had left upon
			his lips.</p>

			<p>&#8220;The devil is loose again,&#8221; whispered Olaf Oleson, as he
			saw Eric dancing a moment later, his eyes blazing.</p>

			<p>But Eric was thinking with an almost savage exultation of
			the time when he should pay for this. Ah, there would be no
			quailing then! If ever a soul went fearlessly, proudly down to
			the gates infernal, his should go. For a moment he fancied he
			was there already, treading down the tempest of flame, hugging
			the fiery hurricane to his breast. He wondered whether
			in ages gone, all the countless years of sinning in which men
			had sold and lost and flung their souls away, any man had
			ever so cheated Satan, had ever bartered his soul for so great a
			price.</p>

			<p>It seemed but a little while till dawn.</p>

			<p>The carriage was brought to the door and Wyllis Elliot and
			his sister said good-by. She could not meet Eric&#8217;s eyes as she
			gave him her hand, but as he stood by the horse&#8217;s head, just
			as the carriage moved off, she gave him one swift glance that
			said, &#8220;I will not forget.&#8221; In a moment the carriage was gone.</p>

			<p>Eric changed his coat and plunged his head into the watertank
			and went to the barn to hook up his team. As he led his
			horses to the door, a shadow fell across his path, and he saw
			Skinner rising in his stirrups. His rugged face was pale and
			worn with looking after his wayward flock, with dragging
			men into the way of salvation.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Good-morning, Eric. There was a dance here last night?&#8221;
			he asked, sternly.</p>

			<p>&#8220;A dance? Oh, yes, a dance,&#8221; replied Eric, cheerfully.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Certainly you did not dance, Eric?&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;Yes, I danced. I danced all the time.&#8221;</p>

			<p>The minister&#8217;s shoulders drooped, and an expression of
			profound discouragement settled over his haggard face. There
			was almost anguish in the yearning he felt for this soul.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Eric, I didn&#8217;t look for this from you. I thought God had
			set his mark on you if he ever had on any man. And it is for
			<a class="pagenum" id="page41" title="41">&nbsp;</a>things like this that you set your soul back a thousand years
			from God. O foolish and perverse generation!&#8221;</p>

			<p>Eric drew himself up to his full height and looked off to
			where the new day was gilding the corn-tassels and flooding
			the uplands with light. As his nostrils drew in the breath of
			the dew and the morning, something from the only poetry he
			had ever read flashed across his mind, and he murmured, half
			to himself, with dreamy exultation:</p>

			<p>&#8220;&#8216;And a day shall be as a thousand years, and a thousand
			years as a day.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

			<h3 class="story_title">The Sentimentality of William Tavener <a class="return_toc" href="#contents" title="Return to Contents">ToC</a></h3>

			<p class="first_paragraph">It takes a strong woman to make any sort of success of
			living in the West, and Hester undoubtedly was that.
			When people spoke of William Tavener as the most prosperous
			farmer in McPherson County, they usually added that his
			wife was a &#8220;good manager.&#8221; She was an executive woman,
			quick of tongue and something of an imperatrix. The only
			reason her husband did not consult her about his business
			was that she did not wait to be consulted.</p>

			<p>It would have been quite impossible for one man, within
			the limited sphere of human action, to follow all Hester&#8217;s advice,
			but in the end William usually acted upon some of her
			suggestions. When she incessantly denounced the &#8220;shiftlessness&#8221;
			of letting a new threshing machine stand unprotected in
			the open, he eventually built a shed for it. When she sniffed
			contemptuously at his notion of fencing a hog corral with
			sod walls, he made a spiritless beginning on the structure&#8212;merely
			to &#8220;show his temper,&#8221; as she put it&#8212;but in the end he
			went off quietly to town and bought enough barbed wire to
			complete the fence. When the first heavy rains came on, and
			the pigs rooted down the sod wall and made little paths all
			over it to facilitate their ascent, he heard his wife relate with
			relish the story of the little pig that built a mud house, to the
			minister at the dinner table, and William&#8217;s gravity never relaxed
			for an instant. Silence, indeed, was William&#8217;s refuge and
			his strength.</p>

			<p>William set his boys a wholesome example to respect their
			mother. People who knew him very well suspected that he
			even admired her. He was a hard man towards his neighbors,
			and even towards his sons; grasping, determined and
			ambitious.</p>

			<p>There was an occasional blue day about the house when
			William went over the store bills, but he never objected to
			items relating to his wife&#8217;s gowns or bonnets. So it came
			about that many of the foolish, unnecessary little things that
			Hester bought for boys, she had charged to her personal
			account.</p>

			<p><a class="pagenum" id="page43" title="43">&nbsp;</a>One spring night Hester sat in a rocking chair by the sitting
			room window, darning socks. She rocked violently and
			sent her long needle vigorously back and forth over her
			gourd, and it took only a very casual glance to see that she
			was wrought up over something. William sat on the other
			side of the table reading his farm paper. If he had noticed his
			wife&#8217;s agitation, his calm, clean-shaven face betrayed no sign
			of concern. He must have noticed the sarcastic turn of her
			remarks at the supper table, and he must have noticed the
			moody silence of the older boys as they ate. When supper was
			but half over little Billy, the youngest, had suddenly pushed
			back his plate and slipped away from the table, manfully
			trying to swallow a sob. But William Tavener never heeded
			ominous forecasts in the domestic horizon, and he never
			looked for a storm until it broke.</p>

			<p>After supper the boys had gone to the pond under the willows
			in the big cattle corral, to get rid of the dust of plowing.
			Hester could hear an occasional splash and a laugh ringing
			clear through the stillness of the night, as she sat by the open
			window. She sat silent for almost an hour reviewing in her
			mind many plans of attack. But she was too vigorous a
			woman to be much of a strategist, and she usually came to her
			point with directness. At last she cut her thread and suddenly
			put her darning down, saying emphatically:</p>

			<p>&#8220;William, I don&#8217;t think it would hurt you to let the boys go
			to that circus in town to-morrow.&#8221;</p>

			<p>William continued to read his farm paper, but it was not
			Hester&#8217;s custom to wait for an answer. She usually divined
			his arguments and assailed them one by one before he uttered
			them.</p>

			<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve been short of hands all summer, and you&#8217;ve
			worked the boys hard, and a man ought use his own flesh and
			blood as well as he does his hired hands. We&#8217;re plenty able to
			afford it, and it&#8217;s little enough our boys ever spend. I don&#8217;t
			see how you can expect &#8217;em to be steady and hard workin&#8217;,
			unless you encourage &#8217;em a little. I never could see much
			harm in circuses, and our boys have never been to one. Oh, I
			know Jim Howley&#8217;s boys get drunk an&#8217; carry on when they
			go, but our boys ain&#8217;t that sort, an&#8217; you know it, William. The
			animals are real instructive, an&#8217; our boys don&#8217;t get to see
			<a class="pagenum" id="page44" title="44">&nbsp;</a>much out here on the prairie. It was different where we were
			raised, but the boys have got no advantages here, an&#8217; if you
			don&#8217;t take care, they&#8217;ll grow up to be greenhorns.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Hester paused a moment, and William folded up his paper,
			but vouchsafed no remark. His sisters in Virginia had often
			said that only a quiet man like William could ever have lived
			with Hester Perkins. Secretly, William was rather proud of his
			wife&#8217;s &#8220;gift of speech,&#8221; and of the fact that she could talk in
			prayer meeting as fluently as a man. He confined his own
			efforts in that line to a brief prayer at Covenant meetings.</p>

			<p>Hester shook out another sock and went on.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Nobody was ever hurt by goin&#8217; to a circus. Why, law me!
			I remember I went to one myself once, when I was little. I
			had most forgot about it. It was over at Pewtown, an&#8217; I remember
			how I had set my heart on going. I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;d
			ever forgiven my father if he hadn&#8217;t taken me, though that red
			clay road was in a frightful way after the rain. I mind they had
			an elephant and six poll parrots, an&#8217; a Rocky Mountain lion,
			an&#8217; a cage of monkeys, an&#8217; two camels. My! but they were a
			sight to me then!&#8221;</p>

			<p>Hester dropped the black sock and shook her head and
			smiled at the recollection. She was not expecting anything
			from William yet, and she was fairly startled when he said
			gravely, in much the same tone in which he announced the
			hymns in prayer meeting:</p>

			<p>&#8220;No, there was only one camel. The other was a dromedary.&#8221;</p>

			<p>She peered around the lamp and looked at him keenly.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Why, William, how come you to know?&#8221;</p>

			<p>William folded his paper and answered with some hesitation,
			&#8220;I was there, too.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Hester&#8217;s interest flashed up.&#8212;&#8220;Well, I never, William! To
			think of my finding it out after all these years! Why, you
			couldn&#8217;t have been much bigger&#8217;n our Billy then. It seems
			queer I never saw you when you was little, to remember
			about you. But then you Back Creek folks never have anything
			to do with us Gap people. But how come you to go?
			Your father was stricter with you than you are with your
			boys.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;I reckon I shouldn&#8217;t &#8217;a gone,&#8221; he said slowly, &#8220;but boys
			<a class="pagenum" id="page45" title="45">&nbsp;</a>will do foolish things. I had done a good deal of fox hunting
			the winter before, and father let me keep the bounty money. I
			hired Tom Smith&#8217;s Tap to weed the corn for me, an&#8217; I slipped
			off unbeknownst to father an&#8217; went to the show.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Hester spoke up warmly: &#8220;Nonsense, William! It didn&#8217;t do
			you no harm, I guess. You was always worked hard enough.
			It must have been a big sight for a little fellow. That clown
			must have just tickled you to death.&#8221;</p>

			<p>William crossed his knees and leaned back in his chair.</p>

			<p>&#8220;I reckon I could tell all that fool&#8217;s jokes now. Sometimes I
			can&#8217;t help thinkin&#8217; about &#8217;em in meetin&#8217; when the sermon&#8217;s
			long. I mind I had on a pair of new boots that hurt me like
			the mischief, but I forgot all about &#8217;em when that fellow rode
			the donkey. I recall I had to take them boots off as soon as I
			got out of sight o&#8217; town, and walked home in the mud barefoot.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;O poor little fellow!&#8221; Hester ejaculated, drawing her chair
			nearer and leaning her elbows on the table. &#8220;What cruel shoes
			they did use to make for children. I remember I went up to
			Back Creek to see the circus wagons go by. They came down
			from Romney, you know. The circus men stopped at the
			creek to water the animals, an&#8217; the elephant got stubborn an&#8217;
			broke a big limb off the yellow willow tree that grew there by
			the toll house porch, an&#8217; the Scribners were &#8217;fraid as death
			he&#8217;d pull the house down. But this much I saw him do; he
			waded in the creek an&#8217; filled his trunk with water, and
			squirted it in at the window and nearly ruined Ellen Scribner&#8217;s
			pink lawn dress that she had just ironed an&#8217; laid out on
			the bed ready to wear to the circus.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;I reckon that must have been a trial to Ellen,&#8221; chuckled
			William, &#8220;for she was mighty prim in them days.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Hester drew her chair still nearer William&#8217;s. Since the
			children had begun growing up, her conversation with her
			husband had been almost wholly confined to questions of
			economy and expense. Their relationship had become purely
			a business one, like that between landlord and tenant. In her
			desire to indulge her boys she had unconsciously assumed a
			defensive and almost hostile attitude towards her husband.
			No debtor ever haggled with his usurer more doggedly than
			did Hester with her husband in behalf of her sons. The strategic
			<a class="pagenum" id="page46" title="46">&nbsp;</a>contest had gone on so long that it had almost crowded
			out the memory of a closer relationship. This exchange of
			confidences to-night, when common recollections took them
			unawares and opened their hearts, had all the miracle of romance.
			They talked on and on; of old neighbors, of old familiar
			faces in the valley where they had grown up, of long
			forgotten incidents of their youth&#8212;weddings, picnics, sleighing
			parties and baptizings. For years they had talked of nothing
			else but butter and eggs and the prices of things, and now
			they had as much to say to each other as people who meet
			after a long separation.</p>

			<p>When the clock struck ten, William rose and went over to
			his walnut secretary and unlocked it. From his red leather
			wallet he took out a ten dollar bill and laid it on the table
			beside Hester.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Tell the boys not to stay late, an&#8217; not to drive the horses
			hard,&#8221; he said quietly, and went off to bed.</p>

			<p>Hester blew out the lamp and sat still in the dark a long
			time. She left the bill lying on the table where William had
			placed it. She had a painful sense of having missed something,
			or lost something; she felt that somehow the years had
			cheated her.</p>

			<p>The little locust trees that grew by the fence were white
			with blossoms. Their heavy odor floated in to her on the
			night wind and recalled a night long ago, when the first whip-poor-Will
			of the Spring was heard, and the rough, buxom
			girls of Hawkins Gap had held her laughing and struggling
			under the locust trees, and searched in her bosom for a lock
			of her sweetheart&#8217;s hair, which is supposed to be on every
			girl&#8217;s breast when the first whip-poor-Will sings. Two of
			those same girls had been her bridesmaids. Hester had been a
			very happy bride. She rose and went softly into the room
			where William lay. He was sleeping heavily, but occasionally
			moved his hand before his face to ward off the flies. Hester
			went into the parlor and took the piece of mosquito net from
			the basket of wax apples and pears that her sister had made
			before she died. One of the boys had brought it all the way
			from Virginia, packed in a tin pail, since Hester would not
			risk shipping so precious an ornament by freight. She went
			back to the bed room and spread the net over William&#8217;s head.</p>

			<p><a class="pagenum" id="page47" title="47">&nbsp;</a>Then she sat down by the bed and listened to his deep, regular
			breathing until she heard the boys returning. She went out
			to meet them and warn them not to waken their father.</p>

			<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll be up early to get your breakfast, boys. Your father says
			you can go to the show.&#8221; As she handed the money to the
			eldest, she felt a sudden throb of allegiance to her husband
			and said sharply, &#8220;And you be careful of that, an&#8217; don&#8217;t waste
			it. Your father works hard for his money.&#8221;</p>

			<p>The boys looked at each other in astonishment and felt that
			they had lost a powerful ally.</p>

			<p class="first_paragraph">Seven of us, students, sat one evening in Hartwell&#8217;s
			studio on the Boulevard St. Michel. We were all fellow-countrymen;
			one from New Hampshire, one from Colorado,
			another from Nevada, several from the farm lands of the
			Middle West, and I myself from California. Lyon Hartwell,
			though born abroad, was simply, as every one knew, &#8220;from
			America.&#8221; He seemed, almost more than any other one living
			man, to mean all of it&#8212;from ocean to ocean. When he was in
			Paris, his studio was always open to the seven of us who were
			there that evening, and we intruded upon his leisure as often
			as we thought permissible.</p>

			<p>Although we were within the terms of the easiest of all
			intimacies, and although the great sculptor, even when he was
			more than usually silent, was at all times the most gravely
			cordial of hosts, yet, on that long remembered evening, as the
			sunlight died on the burnished brown of the horse-chestnuts
			below the windows, a perceptible dullness yawned through
			our conversation.</p>

			<p>We were, indeed, somewhat low in spirit, for one of our
			number, Charley Bentley, was leaving us indefinitely, in response
			to an imperative summons from home. To-morrow his
			studio, just across the hall from Hartwell&#8217;s, was to pass into
			other hands, and Bentley&#8217;s luggage was even now piled in
			discouraged resignation before his door. The various bales
			and boxes seemed literally to weigh upon us as we sat in his
			neighbor&#8217;s hospitable rooms, drearily putting in the time until
			he should leave us to catch the ten o&#8217;clock express for
			Dieppe.</p>

			<p>The day we had got through very comfortably, for Bentley
			made it the occasion of a somewhat pretentious luncheon at
			Maxim&#8217;s. There had been twelve of us at table, and the two
			young Poles were thirsty, the Gascon so fabulously entertaining,
			that it was near upon five o&#8217;clock when we put down our
			liqueur glasses for the last time, and the red, perspiring
			waiter, having pocketed the reward of his arduous and protracted
			services, bowed us affably to the door, flourishing his
			<a class="pagenum" id="page49" title="49">&nbsp;</a>napkin and brushing back the streaks of wet, black hair from
			his rosy forehead. Our guests having betaken themselves belated
			to their respective engagements, the rest of us returned
			with Bentley&#8212;only to be confronted by the depressing array
			before his door. A glance about his denuded rooms had sufficed
			to chill the glow of the afternoon, and we fled across the
			hall in a body and begged Lyon Hartwell to take us in.</p>

			<p>Bentley had said very little about it, but we all knew what it
			meant to him to be called home. Each of us knew what it
			would mean to himself, and each had felt something of that
			quickened sense of opportunity which comes at seeing another
			man in any way counted out of the race. Never had the
			game seemed so enchanting, the chance to play it such a piece
			of unmerited, unbelievable good fortune.</p>

			<p>It must have been, I think, about the middle of October,
			for I remember that the sycamores were almost bare in the
			Luxembourg Gardens that morning, and the terrace about the
			queens of France were strewn with crackling brown leaves.
			The fat red roses, out the summer long on the stand of the
			old flower woman at the corner, had given place to dahlias
			and purple asters. First glimpses of autumn toilettes flashed
			from the carriages; wonderful little bonnets nodded at one
			along the Champs-Elysées; and in the Quarter an occasional
			feather boa, red or black or white, brushed one&#8217;s coat sleeve
			in the gay twilight of the early evening. The crisp, sunny autumn
			air was all day full of the stir of people and carriages and
			of the cheer of salutations; greetings of the students, returned
			brown and bearded from their holiday, gossip of people come
			back from Trouville, from St. Valery, from Dieppe, from all
			over Brittany and the Norman coast. Everywhere was the joyousness
			of return, the taking up again of life and work and
			play.</p>

			<p>I had felt ever since early morning that this was the saddest
			of all possible seasons for saying good-by to that old, old city
			of youth, and to that little corner of it on the south shore
			which since the Dark Ages themselves&#8212;yes, and before&#8212;has
			been so peculiarly the land of the young.</p>

			<p>I can recall our very postures as we lounged about Hartwell&#8217;s
			rooms that evening, with Bentley making occasional
			hurried trips to his desolated workrooms across the hall&#8212;as
			<a class="pagenum" id="page50" title="50">&nbsp;</a>if haunted by a feeling of having forgotten something&#8212;or
			stopping to poke nervously at his <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">perroquets</em>, which he had
			bequeathed to Hartwell, gilt cage and all. Our host himself
			sat on the couch, his big, bronze-like shoulders backed up
			against the window, his shaggy head, beaked nose, and long
			chin cut clean against the gray light.</p>

			<p>Our drowsing interest, in so far as it could be said to be
			fixed upon anything, was centered upon Hartwell&#8217;s new figure,
			which stood on the block ready to be cast in bronze,
			intended as a monument for some American battlefield. He
			called it &#8220;The Color Sergeant.&#8221; It was the figure of a young
			soldier running, clutching the folds of a flag, the staff of
			which had been shot away. We had known it in all the stages
			of its growth, and the splendid action and feeling of the thing
			had come to have a kind of special significance for the half
			dozen of us who often gathered at Hartwell&#8217;s rooms&#8212;though,
			in truth, there was as much to dishearten one as to
			inflame, in the case of a man who had done so much in a field
			so amazingly difficult; who had thrown up in bronze all the
			restless, teeming force of that adventurous wave still climbing
			westward in our own land across the waters. We recalled his
			&#8220;Scout,&#8221; his &#8220;Pioneer,&#8221; his &#8220;Gold Seekers,&#8221; and those monuments
			in which he had invested one and another of the heroes
			of the Civil War with such convincing dignity and power.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Where in the world does he get the heat to make an idea
			like that carry?&#8221; Bentley remarked morosely, scowling at the
			clay figure. &#8220;Hang me, Hartwell, if I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s just because
			you&#8217;re not really an American at all, that you can look at
			it like that.&#8221;</p>

			<p>The big man shifted uneasily against the window. &#8220;Yes,&#8221; he
			replied smiling, &#8220;perhaps there is something in that. My citizenship
			was somewhat belated and emotional in its flowering.
			I&#8217;ve half a mind to tell you about it, Bentley.&#8221; He rose uncertainly,
			and, after hesitating a moment, went back into his
			workroom, where he began fumbling among the litter in the
			corners.</p>

			<p>At the prospect of any sort of personal expression from
			Hartwell, we glanced questioningly at one another; for although
			he made us feel that he liked to have us about, we
			were always held at a distance by a certain diffidence of his.
			<a class="pagenum" id="page51" title="51">&nbsp;</a>There were rare occasions&#8212;when he was in the heat of work
			or of ideas&#8212;when he forgot to be shy, but they were so exceptional
			that no flattery was quite so seductive as being taken
			for a moment into Hartwell&#8217;s confidence. Even in the matter
			of opinions&#8212;the commonest of currency in our circle&#8212;he
			was niggardly and prone to qualify. No man ever guarded his
			mystery more effectually. There was a singular, intense spell,
			therefore, about those few evenings when he had broken
			through this excessive modesty, or shyness, or melancholy,
			and had, as it were, committed himself.</p>

			<p>When Hartwell returned from the back room, he brought
			with him an unframed canvas which he put on an easel near
			his clay figure. We drew close about it, for the darkness was
			rapidly coming on. Despite the dullness of the light, we instantly
			recognized the boy of Hartwell&#8217;s &#8220;Color Sergeant.&#8221; It
			was the portrait of a very handsome lad in uniform, standing
			beside a charger impossibly rearing. Not only in his radiant
			countenance and flashing eyes, but in every line of his young
			body there was an energy, a gallantry, a joy of life, that arrested
			and challenged one.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Yes, that&#8217;s where I got the notion,&#8221; Hartwell remarked,
			wandering back to his seat in the window. &#8220;I&#8217;ve wanted to do
			it for years, but I&#8217;ve never felt quite sure of myself. I was
			afraid of missing it. He was an uncle of mine, my father&#8217;s
			half-brother, and I was named for him. He was killed in one
			of the big battles of Sixty-four, when I was a child. I never
			saw him&#8212;never knew him until he had been dead for twenty
			years. And then, one night, I came to know him as we sometimes
			do living persons&#8212;intimately, in a single moment.&#8221;</p>

			<p>He paused to knock the ashes out of his short pipe, refilled
			it, and puffed at it thoughtfully for a few moments with his
			hands on his knees. Then, settling back heavily among the
			cushions and looking absently out of the window, he began
			his story. As he proceeded further and further into the experience
			which he was trying to convey to us, his voice sank so
			low and was sometimes so charged with feeling, that I almost
			thought he had forgotten our presence and was remembering
			aloud. Even Bentley forgot his nervousness in astonishment
			and sat breathless under the spell of the man&#8217;s thus breathing
			his memories out into the dusk.</p>

			<p><a class="pagenum" id="page52" title="52">&nbsp;</a>&#8220;It was just fifteen years ago this last spring that I first went
			home, and Bentley&#8217;s having to cut away like this brings it all
			back to me.</p>

			<p>&#8220;I was born, you know, in Italy. My father was a sculptor,
			though I dare say you&#8217;ve not heard of him. He was one of
			those first fellows who went over after Story and Powers,&#8212;went
			to Italy for &#8216;Art,&#8217; quite simply; to lift from its native
			bough the willing, iridescent bird. Their story is told, informingly
			enough, by some of those ingenuous marble things at
			the Metropolitan. My father came over some time before the
			outbreak of the Civil War, and was regarded as a renegade by
			his family because he did not go home to enter the army. His
			half-brother, the only child of my grandfather&#8217;s second marriage,
			enlisted at fifteen and was killed the next year. I was ten
			years old when the news of his death reached us. My mother
			died the following winter, and I was sent away to a Jesuit
			school, while my father, already ill himself, stayed on at
			Rome, chipping away at his Indian maidens and marble goddesses,
			still gloomily seeking the thing for which he had made
			himself the most unhappy of exiles.</p>

			<p>&#8220;He died when I was fourteen, but even before that I had
			been put to work under an Italian sculptor. He had an almost
			morbid desire that I should carry on his work, under, as he
			often pointed out to me, conditions so much more auspicious.
			He left me in the charge of his one intimate friend, an
			American gentleman in the consulate at Rome, and his instructions
			were that I was to be educated there and to live
			there until I was twenty-one. After I was of age, I came to
			Paris and studied under one master after another until I was
			nearly thirty. Then, almost for the first time, I was confronted
			by a duty which was not my pleasure.</p>

			<p>&#8220;My grandfather&#8217;s death, at an advanced age, left an invalid
			maiden sister of my father&#8217;s quite alone in the world. She had
			suffered for years from a cerebral disease, a slow decay of the
			faculties which rendered her almost helpless. I decided to go
			to America and, if possible, bring her back to Paris, where I
			seemed on my way toward what my poor father had wished
			for me.</p>

			<p>&#8220;On my arrival at my father&#8217;s birthplace, however, I found
			that this was not to be thought of. To tear this timid, feeble,
			<a class="pagenum" id="page53" title="53">&nbsp;</a>shrinking creature, doubly aged by years and illness, from the
			spot where she had been rooted for a lifetime, would have
			been little short of brutality. To leave her to the care of
			strangers seemed equally heartless. There was clearly nothing
			for me to do but to remain and wait for that slow and painless
			malady to run its course. I was there something over two
			years.</p>

			<p>&#8220;My grandfather&#8217;s home, his father&#8217;s homestead before
			him, lay on the high banks of a river in Western Pennsylvania.
			The little town twelve miles down the stream, whither my
			great-grandfather used to drive his ox-wagon on market days,
			had become, in two generations, one of the largest manufacturing
			cities in the world. For hundreds of miles about us the
			gentle hill slopes were honeycombed with gas wells and coal
			shafts; oil derricks creaked in every valley and meadow; the
			brooks were sluggish and discolored with crude petroleum,
			and the air was impregnated by its searching odor. The great
			glass and iron manufactories had come up and up the river
			almost to our very door; their smoky exhalations brooded
			over us, and their crashing was always in our ears. I was
			plunged into the very incandescence of human energy. But,
			though my nerves tingled with the feverish, passionate endeavor
			which snapped in the very air about me, none of these
			great arteries seemed to feed me; this tumultuous life did not
			warm me. On every side were the great muddy rivers, the
			ragged mountains from which the timber was being ruthlessly
			torn away, the vast tracts of wild country, and the gulches
			that were like wounds in the earth; everywhere the glare of
			that relentless energy which followed me like a searchlight
			and seemed to scorch and consume me. I could only hide
			myself in the tangled garden, where the dropping of a leaf or
			the whistle of a bird was the only incident.</p>

			<p>&#8220;The Hartwell homestead had been sold away little by
			little, until all that remained of it was garden and orchard.
			The house, a square brick structure, stood in the midst of a
			great garden which sloped toward the river, ending in a
			grassy bank which fell some forty feet to the water&#8217;s edge.
			The garden was now little more than a tangle of neglected
			shrubbery; damp, rank, and of that intense blue-green peculiar
			to vegetation in smoky places where the sun shines but
			<a class="pagenum" id="page54" title="54">&nbsp;</a>rarely, and the mists form early in the evening and hang late
			in the morning.</p>

			<p>&#8220;I shall never forget it as I saw it first, when I arrived there
			in the chill of a backward June. The long, rank grass, thick
			and soft and falling in billows, was always wet until midday.
			The gravel walks were bordered with great lilac-bushes,
			mock-orange, and bridal-wreath. Back of the house was a neglected
			rose garden, surrounded by a low stone wall over
			which the long suckers trailed and matted. They had wound
			their pink, thorny tentacles, layer upon layer, about the lock
			and the hinges of the rusty iron gate. Even the porches of the
			house, and the very windows, were damp and heavy with
			growth: wistaria, clematis, honeysuckle, and trumpet vine.
			The garden was grown up with trees, especially that part of it
			which lay above the river. The bark of the old locusts was
			blackened by the smoke that crept continually up the valley,
			and their feathery foliage, so merry in its movement and so
			yellow and joyous in its color, seemed peculiarly precious
			under that somber sky. There were sycamores and copper
			beeches; gnarled apple-trees, too old to bear; and fall pear-trees,
			hung with a sharp, hard fruit in October; all with a
			leafage singularly rich and luxuriant, and peculiarly vivid in
			color. The oaks about the house had been old trees when my
			great-grandfather built his cabin there, more than a century
			before, and this garden was almost the only spot for miles
			along the river where any of the original forest growth still
			survived. The smoke from the mills was fatal to trees of the
			larger sort, and even these had the look of doomed things&#8212;bent
			a little toward the town and seemed to wait with head
			inclined before that on-coming, shrieking force.</p>

			<p>&#8220;About the river, too, there was a strange hush, a tragic
			submission&#8212;it was so leaden and sullen in its color, and it
			flowed so soundlessly forever past our door.</p>

			<p>&#8220;I sat there every evening, on the high veranda overlooking
			it, watching the dim outlines of the steep hills on the other
			shore, the flicker of the lights on the island, where there was a
			boat-house, and listening to the call of the boatmen through
			the mist. The mist came as certainly as night, whitened by
			moonshine or starshine. The tin water-pipes went splash,
			splash, with it all evening, and the wind, when it rose at all,
			<a class="pagenum" id="page55" title="55">&nbsp;</a>was little more than a sighing of the old boughs and a troubled
			breath in the heavy grasses.</p>

			<p>&#8220;At first it was to think of my distant friends and my old
			life that I used to sit there; but after awhile it was simply to
			watch the days and weeks go by, like the river which seemed
			to carry them away.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Within the house I was never at home. Month followed
			month, and yet I could feel no sense of kinship with anything
			there. Under the roof where my father and grandfather were
			born, I remained utterly detached. The somber rooms never
			spoke to me, the old furniture never seemed tinctured with
			race. This portrait of my boy uncle was the only thing to
			which I could draw near, the only link with anything I had
			ever known before.</p>

			<p>&#8220;There is a good deal of my father in the face, but it is my
			father transformed and glorified; his hesitating discontent
			drowned in a kind of triumph. From my first day in that
			house, I continually turned to this handsome kinsman of
			mine, wondering in what terms he had lived and had his
			hope; what he had found there to look like that, to bound at
			one, after all those years, so joyously out of the canvas.</p>

			<p>&#8220;From the timid, clouded old woman over whose life I had
			come to watch, I learned that in the backyard, near the old
			rose garden, there was a locust-tree which my uncle had
			planted. After his death, while it was still a slender sapling, his
			mother had a seat built round it, and she used to sit there on
			summer evenings. His grave was under the apple-trees in the
			old orchard.</p>

			<p>&#8220;My aunt could tell me little more than this. There were
			days when she seemed not to remember him at all.</p>

			<p>&#8220;It was from an old soldier in the village that I learned
			the boy&#8217;s story. Lyon was, the old man told me, but fourteen
			when the first enlistment occurred, but was even then
			eager to go. He was in the court-house square every evening
			to watch the recruits at their drill, and when the home company
			was ordered off he rode into the city on his pony to
			see the men board the train and to wave them good-by. The
			next year he spent at home with a tutor, but when he was
			fifteen he held his parents to their promise and went into the
			army. He was color sergeant of his regiment and fell in a
			<a class="pagenum" id="page56" title="56">&nbsp;</a>charge upon the breastworks of a fort about a year after his
			enlistment.</p>

			<p>&#8220;The veteran showed me an account of this charge which
			had been written for the village paper by one of my uncle&#8217;s
			comrades who had seen his part in the engagement. It seems
			that as his company were running at full speed across the bottom
			lands toward the fortified hill, a shell burst over them.
			This comrade, running beside my uncle, saw the colors waver
			and sink as if falling, and looked to see that the boy&#8217;s hand
			and forearm had been torn away by the exploding shrapnel.
			The boy, he thought, did not realize the extent of his injury,
			for he laughed, shouted something which his comrade did
			not catch, caught the flag in his left hand, and ran on up the
			hill. They went splendidly up over the breastworks, but just
			as my uncle, his colors flying, reached the top of the embankment,
			a second shell carried away his left arm at the
			arm-pit, and he fell over the wall with the flag settling about
			him.</p>

			<p>&#8220;It was because this story was ever present with me, because
			I was unable to shake it off, that I began to read such
			books as my grandfather had collected upon the Civil War. I
			found that this war was fought largely by boys, that more
			men enlisted at eighteen than at any other age. When I
			thought of those battlefields&#8212;and I thought of them much
			in those days&#8212;there was always that glory of youth above
			them, that impetuous, generous passion stirring the long lines
			on the march, the blue battalions in the plain. The bugle,
			whenever I have heard it since, has always seemed to me the
			very golden throat of that boyhood which spent itself so
			gaily, so incredibly.</p>

			<p>&#8220;I used often to wonder how it was that this uncle of mine,
			who seemed to have possessed all the charm and brilliancy
			allotted to his family and to have lived up its vitality in one
			splendid hour, had left so little trace in the house where he
			was born and where he had awaited his destiny. Look as I
			would, I could find no letters from him, no clothing or books
			that might have been his. He had been dead but twenty years,
			and yet nothing seemed to have survived except the tree he
			had planted. It seemed incredible and cruel that no physical
			memory of him should linger to be cherished among his
			<a class="pagenum" id="page57" title="57">&nbsp;</a>kindred,&#8212;nothing but the dull image in the brain of that
			aged sister. I used to pace the garden walks in the evening,
			wondering that no breath of his, no echo of his laugh, of his
			call to his pony or his whistle to his dogs, should linger about
			those shaded paths where the pale roses exhaled their dewy,
			country smell. Sometimes, in the dim starlight, I have
			thought that I heard on the grasses beside me the stir of a
			footfall lighter than my own, and under the black arch of the
			lilacs I have fancied that he bore me company.</p>

			<p>&#8220;There was, I found, one day in the year for which my old
			aunt waited, and which stood out from the months that were
			all of a sameness to her. On the thirtieth of May she insisted
			that I should bring down the big flag from the attic and run it
			up upon the tall flagstaff beside Lyon&#8217;s tree in the garden.
			Later in the morning she went with me to carry some of the
			garden flowers to the grave in the orchard,&#8212;a grave scarcely
			larger than a child&#8217;s.</p>

			<p>&#8220;I had noticed, when I was hunting for the flag in the attic,
			a leather trunk with my own name stamped upon it, but was
			unable to find the key. My aunt was all day less apathetic than
			usual; she seemed to realize more clearly who I was, and to
			wish me to be with her. I did not have an opportunity to
			return to the attic until after dinner that evening, when I carried
			a lamp up-stairs and easily forced the lock of the trunk. I
			found all the things that I had looked for; put away, doubtless,
			by his mother, and still smelling faintly of lavender and
			rose leaves; his clothes, his exercise books, his letters from the
			army, his first boots, his riding-whip, some of his toys, even. I
			took them out and replaced them gently. As I was about to
			shut the lid, I picked up a copy of the Æneid, on the fly-leaf
			of which was written in a slanting, boyish hand,</p>

			<blockquote class="call-out"><p>Lyon Hartwell, January, 1862.</p></blockquote>

			<p class="continued_paragraph">He had gone to the wars in Sixty-three, I remembered.</p>

			<p>&#8220;My uncle, I gathered, was none too apt at his Latin, for
			the pages were dog-eared and rubbed and interlined, the margins
			mottled with pencil sketches&#8212;bugles, stacked bayonets,
			and artillery carriages. In the act of putting the book down, I
			happened to run over the pages to the end, and on the fly-leaf
			at the back I saw his name again, and a drawing&#8212;with his
			<a class="pagenum" id="page58" title="58">&nbsp;</a>initials and a date&#8212;of the Federal flag; above it, written in a
			kind of arch and in the same unformed hand:</p>

			<blockquote class="poem">
				<p>&#8216;Oh, say, can you see by the dawn&#8217;s early light</p>
				<p>What so proudly we hailed at the twilight&#8217;s last gleaming?&#8217;</p>
			</blockquote>

			<p>It was a stiff, wooden sketch, not unlike a detail from some
			Egyptian inscription, but, the moment I saw it, wind and
			color seemed to touch it. I caught up the book, blew out the
			lamp, and rushed down into the garden.</p>

			<p>&#8220;I seemed, somehow, at last to have known him; to have
			been with him in that careless, unconscious moment and to
			have known him as he was then.</p>

			<p>&#8220;As I sat there in the rush of this realization, the wind began
			to rise, stirring the light foliage of the locust over my
			head and bringing, fresher than before, the woody odor of
			the pale roses that overran the little neglected garden. Then,
			as it grew stronger, it brought the sound of something sighing
			and stirring over my head in the perfumed darkness.</p>

			<p>&#8220;I thought of that sad one of the Destinies who, as the
			Greeks believed, watched from birth over those marked for a
			violent or untimely death. Oh, I could see him, there in the
			shine of the morning, his book idly on his knee, his flashing
			eyes looking straight before him, and at his side that grave
			figure, hidden in her draperies, her eyes following his, but
			seeing so much farther&#8212;seeing what he never saw, that great
			moment at the end, when he swayed above his comrades on
			the earthen wall.</p>

			<p>&#8220;All the while, the bunting I had run up in the morning
			flapped fold against fold, heaving and tossing softly in the
			dark&#8212;against a sky so black with rain clouds that I could
			see above me only the blur of something in soft, troubled
			motion.</p>

			<p>&#8220;The experience of that night, coming so overwhelmingly
			to a man so dead, almost rent me in pieces. It was the same
			feeling that artists know when we, rarely, achieve truth in our
			work; the feeling of union with some great force, of purpose
			and security, of being glad that we have lived. For the first
			time I felt the pull of race and blood and kindred, and felt
			beating within me things that had not begun with me. It was
			as if the earth under my feet had grasped and rooted me, and
			<a class="pagenum" id="page59" title="59">&nbsp;</a>were pouring its essence into me. I sat there until the dawn of
			morning, and all night long my life seemed to be pouring out
			of me and running into the ground.&#8221;</p>

			<hr class="thoughtbreak "/>

			<p class="post_thoughtbreak">Hartwell drew a long breath that lifted his heavy shoulders,
			and then let them fall again. He shifted a little and faced more
			squarely the scattered, silent company before him. The darkness
			had made us almost invisible to each other, and, except
			for the occasional red circuit of a cigarette end traveling upward
			from the arm of a chair, he might have supposed us all
			asleep.</p>

			<p>&#8220;And so,&#8221; Hartwell added thoughtfully, &#8220;I naturally feel
			an interest in fellows who are going home. It&#8217;s always an experience.&#8221;</p>

			<p>No one said anything, and in a moment there was a loud
			rap at the door,&#8212;the concierge, come to take down Bentley&#8217;s
			luggage and to announce that the cab was below. Bentley got
			his hat and coat, enjoined Hartwell to take good care of his
			<em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">perroquets</em>, gave each of us a grip of the hand, and went
			briskly down the long flights of stairs. We followed him into
			the street, calling our good wishes, and saw him start on his
			drive across the lighted city to the Gare St. Lazare.</p>

			<p class="source"><cite>Harper&#8217;s</cite>, April 1909</p>

			<p class="first_paragraph">We had our swim before sundown, and while we were
			cooking our supper the oblique rays of light made a
			dazzling glare on the white sand about us. The translucent
			red ball itself sank behind the brown stretches of corn field as
			we sat down to eat, and the warm layer of air that had rested
			over the water and our clean sand-bar grew fresher and
			smelled of the rank ironweed and sunflowers growing on the
			flatter shore. The river was brown and sluggish, like any other
			of the half-dozen streams that water the Nebraska corn lands.
			On one shore was an irregular line of bald clay bluffs where a
			few scrub-oaks with thick trunks and flat, twisted tops threw
			light shadows on the long grass. The western shore was low
			and level, with corn fields that stretched to the sky-line, and
			all along the water&#8217;s edge were little sandy coves and beaches
			where slim cottonwoods and willow saplings flickered.</p>

			<p>The turbulence of the river in spring-time discouraged milling,
			and, beyond keeping the old red bridge in repair, the
			busy farmers did not concern themselves with the stream; so
			the Sandtown boys were left in undisputed possession. In the
			autumn we hunted quail through the miles of stubble and
			fodder land along the flat shore, and, after the winter skating
			season was over and the ice had gone out, the spring freshets
			and flooded bottoms gave us our great excitement of the year.
			The channel was never the same for two successive seasons.
			Every spring the swollen stream undermined a bluff to the
			east, or bit out a few acres of corn field to the west and
			whirled the soil away to deposit it in spumy mud banks somewhere
			else. When the water fell low in midsummer, new
			sand-bars were thus exposed to dry and whiten in the August
			sun. Sometimes these were banked so firmly that the fury of
			the next freshet failed to unseat them; the little willow seedlings
			emerged triumphantly from the yellow froth, broke into
			spring leaf, shot up into summer growth, and with their mesh
			of roots bound together the moist sand beneath them against
			the batterings of another April. Here and there a cottonwood
			soon glittered among them, quivering in the low current of
			<a class="pagenum" id="page61" title="61">&nbsp;</a>air that, even on breathless days when the dust hung like
			smoke above the wagon road, trembled along the face of the
			water.</p>

			<p>It was on such an island, in the third summer of its yellow
			green, that we built our watch-fire; not in the thicket of dancing
			willow wands, but on the level terrace of fine sand which
			had been added that spring; a little new bit of world, beautifully
			ridged with ripple marks, and strewn with the tiny skeletons
			of turtles and fish, all as white and dry as if they had
			been expertly cured. We had been careful not to mar the freshness
			of the place, although we often swam out to it on summer
			evenings and lay on the sand to rest.</p>

			<p>This was our last watch-fire of the year, and there were
			reasons why I should remember it better than any of the others.
			Next week the other boys were to file back to their old
			places in the Sandtown High School, but I was to go up to
			the Divide to teach my first country school in the Norwegian
			district. I was already homesick at the thought of quitting the
			boys with whom I had always played; of leaving the river, and
			going up into a windy plain that was all windmills and corn
			fields and big pastures; where there was nothing wilful or unmanageable
			in the landscape, no new islands, and no chance
			of unfamiliar birds&#8212;such as often followed the watercourses.</p>

			<p>Other boys came and went and used the river for fishing or
			skating, but we six were sworn to the spirit of the stream, and
			we were friends mainly because of the river. There were the
			two Hassler boys, Fritz and Otto, sons of the little German
			tailor. They were the youngest of us; ragged boys of ten and
			twelve, with sunburned hair, weather-stained faces, and pale
			blue eyes. Otto, the elder, was the best mathematician in
			school, and clever at his books, but he always dropped out in
			the spring term as if the river could not get on without him.
			He and Fritz caught the fat, horned catfish and sold them
			about the town, and they lived so much in the water that they
			were as brown and sandy as the river itself.</p>

			<p>There was Percy Pound, a fat, freckled boy with chubby
			cheeks, who took half a dozen boys&#8217; story-papers and was always
			being kept in for reading detective stories behind his
			desk. There was Tip Smith, destined by his freckles and red
			hair to be the buffoon in all our games, though he walked like
			<a class="pagenum" id="page62" title="62">&nbsp;</a>a timid little old man and had a funny, cracked laugh. Tip
			worked hard in his father&#8217;s grocery store every afternoon, and
			swept it out before school in the morning. Even his recreations
			were laborious. He collected cigarette cards and tin
			tobacco-tags indefatigably, and would sit for hours humped
			up over a snarling little scroll-saw which he kept in his attic.
			His dearest possessions were some little pill-bottles that purported
			to contain grains of wheat from the Holy Land, water
			from the Jordan and the Dead Sea, and earth from the Mount
			of Olives. His father had bought these dull things from a
			Baptist missionary who peddled them, and Tip seemed to derive
			great satisfaction from their remote origin.</p>

			<p>The tall boy was Arthur Adams. He had fine hazel eyes that
			were almost too reflective and sympathetic for a boy, and
			such a pleasant voice that we all loved to hear him read aloud.
			Even when he had to read poetry aloud at school, no one ever
			thought of laughing. To be sure, he was not at school very
			much of the time. He was seventeen and should have finished
			the High School the year before, but he was always off somewhere
			with his gun. Arthur&#8217;s mother was dead, and his
			father, who was feverishly absorbed in promoting schemes,
			wanted to send the boy away to school and get him off his
			hands; but Arthur always begged off for another year and
			promised to study. I remember him as a tall, brown boy with
			an intelligent face, always lounging among a lot of us little
			fellows, laughing at us oftener than with us, but such a soft,
			satisfied laugh that we felt rather flattered when we provoked
			it. In after-years people said that Arthur had been given to
			evil ways even as a lad, and it is true that we often saw him
			with the gambler&#8217;s sons and with old Spanish Fanny&#8217;s boy,
			but if he learned anything ugly in their company he never
			betrayed it to us. We would have followed Arthur anywhere,
			and I am bound to say that he led us into no worse places
			than the cattail marshes and the stubble fields. These, then,
			were the boys who camped with me that summer night upon
			the sand-bar.</p>

			<p>After we finished our supper we beat the willow thicket for
			driftwood. By the time we had collected enough, night had
			fallen, and the pungent, weedy smell from the shore increased
			with the coolness. We threw ourselves down about the fire
			<a class="pagenum" id="page63" title="63">&nbsp;</a>and made another futile effort to show Percy Pound the Little
			Dipper. We had tried it often before, but he could never be
			got past the big one.</p>

			<p>&#8220;You see those three big stars just below the handle, with
			the bright one in the middle?&#8221; said Otto Hassler; &#8220;that&#8217;s
			Orion&#8217;s belt, and the bright one is the clasp.&#8221; I crawled behind
			Otto&#8217;s shoulder and sighted up his arm to the star that
			seemed perched upon the tip of his steady forefinger. The
			Hassler boys did seine-fishing at night, and they knew a good
			many stars.</p>

			<p>Percy gave up the Little Dipper and lay back on the sand,
			his hands clasped under his head. &#8220;I can see the North Star,&#8221;
			he announced, contentedly, pointing toward it with his big
			toe. &#8220;Any one might get lost and need to know that.&#8221;</p>

			<p>We all looked up at it.</p>

			<p>&#8220;How do you suppose Columbus felt when his compass
			didn&#8217;t point north any more?&#8221; Tip asked.</p>

			<p>Otto shook his head. &#8220;My father says that there was another
			North Star once, and that maybe this one won&#8217;t last
			always. I wonder what would happen to us down here if anything
			went wrong with it?&#8221;</p>

			<p>Arthur chuckled. &#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t worry, Ott. Nothing&#8217;s apt to
			happen to it in your time. Look at the Milky Way! There
			must be lots of good dead Indians.&#8221;</p>

			<p>We lay back and looked, meditating, at the dark cover
			of the world. The gurgle of the water had become heavier.
			We had often noticed a mutinous, complaining note in it at
			night, quite different from its cheerful daytime chuckle, and
			seeming like the voice of a much deeper and more powerful
			stream. Our water had always these two moods: the one of
			sunny complaisance, the other of inconsolable, passionate
			regret.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Queer how the stars are all in sort of diagrams,&#8221; remarked
			Otto. &#8220;You could do most any proposition in geometry with
			&#8217;em. They always look as if they meant something. Some folks
			say everybody&#8217;s fortune is all written out in the stars, don&#8217;t
			they?&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;They believe so in the old country,&#8221; Fritz affirmed.</p>

			<p>But Arthur only laughed at him. &#8220;You&#8217;re thinking of Napoleon,
			Fritzey. He had a star that went out when he began to
			<a class="pagenum" id="page64" title="64">&nbsp;</a>lose battles. I guess the stars don&#8217;t keep any close tally on
			Sandtown folks.&#8221;</p>

			<p>We were speculating on how many times we could count a
			hundred before the evening star went down behind the corn
			fields, when some one cried, &#8220;There comes the moon, and it&#8217;s
			as big as a cart wheel!&#8221;</p>

			<p>We all jumped up to greet it as it swam over the bluffs
			behind us. It came up like a galleon in full sail; an enormous,
			barbaric thing, red as an angry heathen god.</p>

			<p>&#8220;When the moon came up red like that, the Aztecs used to
			sacrifice their prisoners on the temple top,&#8221; Percy announced.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Go on, Perce. You got that out of <cite>Golden Days</cite>. Do you
			believe that, Arthur?&#8221; I appealed.</p>

			<p>Arthur answered, quite seriously: &#8220;Like as not. The moon
			was one of their gods. When my father was in Mexico City he
			saw the stone where they used to sacrifice their prisoners.&#8221;</p>

			<p>As we dropped down by the fire again some one asked
			whether the Mound-Builders were older than the Aztecs.
			When we once got upon the Mound-Builders we never willingly
			got away from them, and we were still conjecturing
			when we heard a loud splash in the water.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Must have been a big cat jumping,&#8221; said Fritz. &#8220;They do
			sometimes. They must see bugs in the dark. Look what a
			track the moon makes!&#8221;</p>

			<p>There was a long, silvery streak on the water, and where
			the current fretted over a big log it boiled up like gold
			pieces.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Suppose there ever <em>was</em> any gold hid away in this old
			river?&#8221; Fritz asked. He lay like a little brown Indian, close
			to the fire, his chin on his hand and his bare feet in the air.
			His brother laughed at him, but Arthur took his suggestion
			seriously.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Some of the Spaniards thought there was gold up here
			somewhere. Seven cities chuck full of gold, they had it, and
			Coronado and his men came up to hunt it. The Spaniards
			were all over this country once.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Percy looked interested. &#8220;Was that before the Mormons
			went through?&#8221;</p>

			<p>We all laughed at this.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Long enough before. Before the Pilgrim Fathers, Perce.
			<a class="pagenum" id="page65" title="65">&nbsp;</a>Maybe they came along this very river. They always followed
			the watercourses.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;I wonder where this river really does begin?&#8221; Tip mused.
			That was an old and a favorite mystery which the map did not
			clearly explain. On the map the little black line stopped somewhere
			in western Kansas; but since rivers generally rose in
			mountains, it was only reasonable to suppose that ours came
			from the Rockies. Its destination, we knew, was the Missouri,
			and the Hassler boys always maintained that we could embark
			at Sandtown in flood-time, follow our noses, and eventually
			arrive at New Orleans. Now they took up their old argument.
			&#8220;If us boys had grit enough to try it, it wouldn&#8217;t take no time
			to get to Kansas City and St. Joe.&#8221;</p>

			<p>We began to talk about the places we wanted to go to. The
			Hassler boys wanted to see the stock-yards in Kansas City,
			and Percy wanted to see a big store in Chicago. Arthur was
			interlocutor and did not betray himself.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Now it&#8217;s your turn, Tip.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Tip rolled over on his elbow and poked the fire, and his
			eyes looked shyly out of his queer, tight little face. &#8220;My place
			is awful far away. My uncle Bill told me about it.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Tip&#8217;s Uncle Bill was a wanderer, bitten with mining fever,
			who had drifted into Sandtown with a broken arm, and when
			it was well had drifted out again.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Where is it?&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;Aw, it&#8217;s down in New Mexico somewheres. There aren&#8217;t
			no railroads or anything. You have to go on mules, and you
			run out of water before you get there and have to drink
			canned tomatoes.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;Well, go on, kid. What&#8217;s it like when you do get there?&#8221;</p>

			<p>Tip sat up and excitedly began his story.</p>

			<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a big red rock there that goes right up out of
			the sand for about nine hundred feet. The country&#8217;s flat all
			around it, and this here rock goes up all by itself, like a monument.
			They call it the Enchanted Bluff down there, because
			no white man has ever been on top of it. The sides are
			smooth rock, and straight up, like a wall. The Indians say that
			hundreds of years ago, before the Spaniards came, there was a
			village away up there in the air. The tribe that lived there had
			some sort of steps, made out of wood and bark, hung down
			<a class="pagenum" id="page66" title="66">&nbsp;</a>over the face of the bluff, and the braves went down to hunt
			and carried water up in big jars swung on their backs. They
			kept a big supply of water and dried meat up there, and never
			went down except to hunt. They were a peaceful tribe that
			made cloth and pottery, and they went up there to get out of
			the wars. You see, they could pick off any war party that tried
			to get up their little steps. The Indians say they were a handsome
			people, and they had some sort of a queer religion.
			Uncle Bill thinks they were Cliff-Dwellers who had got into
			trouble and left home. They weren&#8217;t fighters, anyhow.</p>

			<p>&#8220;One time the braves were down hunting and an awful
			storm came up&#8212;a kind of waterspout&#8212;and when they got
			back to their rock they found their little staircase had been all
			broken to pieces, and only a few steps were left hanging away
			up in the air. While they were camped at the foot of the rock,
			wondering what to do, a war party from the north came
			along and massacred &#8217;em to a man, with all the old folks and
			women looking on from the rock. Then the war party went
			on south and left the village to get down the best way they
			could. Of course they never got down. They starved to death
			up there, and when the war party came back on their way
			north, they could hear the children crying from the edge of
			the bluff where they had crawled out, but they didn&#8217;t see a
			sign of a grown Indian, and nobody has ever been up there
			since.&#8221;</p>

			<p>We exclaimed at this dolorous legend and sat up.</p>

			<p>&#8220;There couldn&#8217;t have been many people up there,&#8221; Percy
			demurred. &#8220;How big is the top, Tip?&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;Oh, pretty big. Big enough so that the rock doesn&#8217;t look
			nearly as tall as it is. The top&#8217;s bigger than the base. The bluff
			is sort of worn away for several hundred feet up. That&#8217;s one
			reason it&#8217;s so hard to climb.&#8221;</p>

			<p>I asked how the Indians got up, in the first place.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Nobody knows how they got up or when. A hunting
			party came along once and saw that there was a town up
			there, and that was all.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Otto rubbed his chin and looked thoughtful. &#8220;Of course
			there must be some way to get up there. Couldn&#8217;t people get
			a rope over someway and pull a ladder up?&#8221;</p>

			<p>Tip&#8217;s little eyes were shining with excitement. &#8220;I know a
			<a class="pagenum" id="page67" title="67">&nbsp;</a>way. Me and Uncle Bill talked it all over. There&#8217;s a kind of
			rocket that would take a rope over&#8212;life-savers use &#8217;em&#8212;and
			then you could hoist a rope-ladder and peg it down at the
			bottom and make it tight with guy-ropes on the other side.
			I&#8217;m going to climb that there bluff, and I&#8217;ve got it all planned
			out.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Fritz asked what he expected to find when he got up there.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Bones, maybe, or the ruins of their town, or pottery, or
			some of their idols. There might be &#8217;most anything up there.
			Anyhow, I want to see.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;Sure nobody else has been up there, Tip?&#8221; Arthur asked.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Dead sure. Hardly anybody ever goes down there. Some
			hunters tried to cut steps in the rock once, but they didn&#8217;t get
			higher than a man can reach. The Bluff&#8217;s all red granite, and
			Uncle Bill thinks it&#8217;s a boulder the glaciers left. It&#8217;s a queer
			place, anyhow. Nothing but cactus and desert for hundreds of
			miles, and yet right under the bluff there&#8217;s good water and
			plenty of grass. That&#8217;s why the bison used to go down there.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Suddenly we heard a scream above our fire, and jumped up
			to see a dark, slim bird floating southward far above us&#8212;a
			whooping-crane, we knew by her cry and her long neck. We
			ran to the edge of the island, hoping we might see her alight,
			but she wavered southward along the rivercourse until we lost
			her. The Hassler boys declared that by the look of the heavens
			it must be after midnight, so we threw more wood on our
			fire, put on our jackets, and curled down in the warm sand.
			Several of us pretended to doze, but I fancy we were really
			thinking about Tip&#8217;s Bluff and the extinct people. Over in the
			wood the ring-doves were calling mournfully to one another,
			and once we heard a dog bark, far away. &#8220;Somebody getting
			into old Tommy&#8217;s melon patch,&#8221; Fritz murmured, sleepily,
			but nobody answered him. By and by Percy spoke out of the
			shadow.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Say, Tip, when you go down there will you take me with
			you?&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;Maybe.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;Suppose one of us beats you down there, Tip?&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;Whoever gets to the Bluff first has got to promise to tell
			the rest of us exactly what he finds,&#8221; remarked one of the
			Hassler boys, and to this we all readily assented.</p>

			<p><a class="pagenum" id="page68" title="68">&nbsp;</a>Somewhat reassured, I dropped off to sleep. I must have
			dreamed about a race for the Bluff, for I awoke in a kind of
			fear that other people were getting ahead of me and that I
			was losing my chance. I sat up in my damp clothes and
			looked at the other boys, who lay tumbled in uneasy attitudes
			about the dead fire. It was still dark, but the sky was blue
			with the last wonderful azure of night. The stars glistened like
			crystal globes, and trembled as if they shone through a depth
			of clear water. Even as I watched, they began to pale and the
			sky brightened. Day came suddenly, almost instantaneously. I
			turned for another look at the blue night, and it was gone.
			Everywhere the birds began to call, and all manner of little
			insects began to chirp and hop about in the willows. A breeze
			sprang up from the west and brought the heavy smell of ripened
			corn. The boys rolled over and shook themselves. We
			stripped and plunged into the river just as the sun came up
			over the windy bluffs.</p>

			<p>When I came home to Sandtown at Christmas time, we
			skated out to our island and talked over the whole project of
			the Enchanted Bluff, renewing our resolution to find it.</p>

			<hr class="thoughtbreak" />

			<p class="post_thoughtbreak">Although that was twenty years ago, none of us have ever
			climbed the Enchanted Bluff. Percy Pound is a stockbroker in
			Kansas City and will go nowhere that his red touring-car cannot
			carry him. Otto Hassler went on the railroad and lost his
			foot braking; after which he and Fritz succeeded their father
			as the town tailors.</p>

			<p>Arthur sat about the sleepy little town all his life&#8212;he died
			before he was twenty-five. The last time I saw him, when I
			was home on one of my college vacations, he was sitting in a
			steamer-chair under a cottonwood tree in the little yard behind
			one of the two Sandtown saloons. He was very untidy
			and his hand was not steady, but when he rose, unabashed, to
			greet me, his eyes were as clear and warm as ever. When I had
			talked with him for an hour and heard him laugh again, I
			wondered how it was that when Nature had taken such pains
			with a man, from his hands to the arch of his long foot, she
			had ever lost him in Sandtown. He joked about Tip Smith&#8217;s
			Bluff, and declared he was going down there just as soon as
			<a class="pagenum" id="page69" title="69">&nbsp;</a>the weather got cooler; he thought the Grand Cañon might
			be worth while, too.</p>

			<p>I was perfectly sure when I left him that he would never get
			beyond the high plank fence and the comfortable shade of the
			cottonwood. And, indeed, it was under that very tree that he
			died one summer morning.</p>

			<p>Tip Smith still talks about going to New Mexico. He married
			a slatternly, unthrifty country girl, has been much tied to
			a perambulator, and has grown stooped and gray from irregular
			meals and broken sleep. But the worst of his difficulties
			are now over, and he has, as he says, come into easy
			water. When I was last in Sandtown I walked home with him
			late one moonlight night, after he had balanced his cash and
			shut up his store. We took the long way around and sat down
			on the schoolhouse steps, and between us we quite revived
			the romance of the lone red rock and the extinct people. Tip
			insists that he still means to go down there, but he thinks
			now he will wait until his boy, Bert, is old enough to go with
			him. Bert has been let into the story, and thinks of nothing
			but the Enchanted Bluff.</p>

			<h3 class="story_title">The Joy of Nelly Deane</h3>
			<p class="first_paragraph">Nell and I were almost ready to go on for the last act of
			&#8220;Queen Esther,&#8221; and we had for the moment got rid of
			our three patient dressers, Mrs. Dow, Mrs. Freeze, and Mrs.
			Spinny. Nell was peering over my shoulder into the little
			cracked looking-glass that Mrs. Dow had taken from its nail
			on her kitchen wall and brought down to the church under
			her shawl that morning. When she realized that we were
			alone, Nell whispered to me in the quick, fierce way she had:</p>

			<p>&#8220;Say, Peggy, won&#8217;t you go up and stay with me to-night?
			Scott Spinny&#8217;s asked to take me home, and I don&#8217;t want to
			walk up with him alone.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;I guess so, if you&#8217;ll ask my mother.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;ll fix her!&#8221; Nell laughed, with a toss of her head
			which meant that she usually got what she wanted, even from
			people much less tractable than my mother.</p>

			<p>In a moment our tiring-women were back again. The three
			old ladies&#8212;at least they seemed old to us&#8212;fluttered about
			us, more agitated than we were ourselves. It seemed as
			though they would never leave off patting Nell and touching
			her up. They kept trying things this way and that, never able
			in the end to decide which way was best. They wouldn&#8217;t hear
			to her using rouge, and as they powdered her neck and arms,
			Mrs. Freeze murmured that she hoped we wouldn&#8217;t get into
			the habit of using such things. Mrs. Spinny divided her time
			between pulling up and tucking down the &#8220;illusion&#8221; that filled
			in the square neck of Nelly&#8217;s dress. She didn&#8217;t like things
			much low, she said; but after she had pulled it up, she stood
			back and looked at Nell thoughtfully through her glasses.
			While the excited girl was reaching for this and that, buttoning
			a slipper, pinning down a curl, Mrs. Spinny&#8217;s smile softened
			more and more until, just before <em>Esther</em> made her
			entrance, the old lady tiptoed up to her and softly tucked the
			illusion down as far as it would go.</p>

			<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s so pink; it seems a pity not,&#8221; she whispered apologetically
			to Mrs. Dow.</p>

			<p>Every one admitted that Nelly was the prettiest girl in
			<a class="pagenum" id="page71" title="71">&nbsp;</a>Riverbend, and the gayest&#8212;oh, the gayest! When she was
			not singing, she was laughing. When she was not laid up with
			a broken arm, the outcome of a foolhardy coasting feat, or
			suspended from school because she ran away at recess to go
			buggy-riding with Guy Franklin, she was sure to be up to
			mischief of some sort. Twice she broke through the ice and
			got soused in the river because she never looked where she
			skated or cared what happened so long as she went fast
			enough. After the second of these duckings our three dressers
			declared that she was trying to be a Baptist despite herself.</p>

			<p>Mrs. Spinny and Mrs. Freeze and Mrs. Dow, who were
			always hovering about Nelly, often whispered to me their
			hope that she would eventually come into our church and not
			&#8220;go with the Methodists&#8221;; her family were Wesleyans. But to
			me these artless plans of theirs never wholly explained their
			watchful affection. They had good daughters themselves,&#8212;except
			Mrs. Spinny, who had only the sullen Scott,&#8212;and
			they loved their plain girls and thanked God for them. But
			they loved Nelly differently. They were proud of her pretty
			figure and yellow-brown eyes, which dilated so easily and
			sparkled with a kind of golden effervescence. They were always
			making pretty things for her, always coaxing her to
			come to the sewing-circle, where she knotted her thread, and
			put in the wrong sleeve, and laughed and chattered and said a
			great many things that she should not have said, and somehow
			always warmed their hearts. I think they loved her for
			her unquenchable joy.</p>

			<p>All the Baptist ladies liked Nell, even those who criticized
			her most severely, but the three who were first in fighting the
			battles of our little church, who held it together by their
			prayers and the labor of their hands, watched over her as they
			did over Mrs. Dow&#8217;s century-plant before it blossomed. They
			looked for her on Sunday morning and smiled at her as she
			hurried, always a little late, up to the choir. When she rose
			and stood behind the organ and sang &#8220;There Is a Green
			Hill,&#8221; one could see Mrs. Dow and Mrs. Freeze settle back in
			their accustomed seats and look up at her as if she had just
			come from that hill and had brought them glad tidings.</p>

			<p>It was because I sang contralto, or, as we said, alto, in the
			Baptist choir that Nell and I became friends. She was so gay
			<a class="pagenum" id="page72" title="72">&nbsp;</a>and grown up, so busy with parties and dances and picnics,
			that I would scarcely have seen much of her had we not sung
			together. She liked me better than she did any of the older
			girls, who tried clumsily to be like her, and I felt almost as
			solicitous and admiring as did Mrs. Dow and Mrs. Spinny. I
			think even then I must have loved to see her bloom and glow,
			and I loved to hear her sing, in &#8220;The Ninety and Nine,&#8221;</p>

			<blockquote class="call-out"><p>But one was out on the hills away</p></blockquote>

			<p class="continued_paragraph">in her sweet, strong voice. Nell had never had a singing lesson,
			but she had sung from the time she could talk, and Mrs.
			Dow used fondly to say that it was singing so much that
			made her figure so pretty.</p>

			<p>After I went into the choir it was found to be easier to get
			Nelly to choir practice. If I stopped outside her gate on my
			way to church and coaxed her, she usually laughed, ran in for
			her hat and jacket, and went along with me. The three old
			ladies fostered our friendship, and because I was &#8220;quiet,&#8221; they
			esteemed me a good influence for Nelly. This view was propounded
			in a sewing-circle discussion and, leaking down to
			us through our mothers, greatly amused us. Dear old ladies!
			It was so manifestly for what Nell was that they loved her,
			and yet they were always looking for &#8220;influences&#8221; to change
			her.</p>

			<p>The &#8220;Queen Esther&#8221; performance had cost us three months
			of hard practice, and it was not easy to keep Nell up to attending
			the tedious rehearsals. Some of the boys we knew
			were in the chorus of Assyrian youths, but the solo cast was
			made up of older people, and Nell found them very poky. We
			gave the cantata in the Baptist church on Christmas eve, &#8220;to a
			crowded house,&#8221; as the Riverbend &#8220;Messenger&#8221; truly chronicled.
			The country folk for miles about had come in through a
			deep snow, and their teams and wagons stood in a long row
			at the hitch-bars on each side of the church door. It was certainly
			Nelly&#8217;s night, for however much the tenor&#8212;he was
			her schoolmaster, and naturally thought poorly of her&#8212;might
			try to eclipse her in his dolorous solos about the rivers
			of Babylon, there could be no doubt as to whom the people
			had come to hear&#8212;and to see.</p>

			<p>After the performance was over, our fathers and mothers
			<a class="pagenum" id="page73" title="73">&nbsp;</a>came back to the dressing-rooms&#8212;the little rooms behind
			the baptistry where the candidates for baptism were robed&#8212;to
			congratulate us, and Nell persuaded my mother to let
			me go home with her. This arrangement may not have been
			wholly agreeable to Scott Spinny, who stood glumly waiting
			at the baptistry door; though I used to think he dogged Nell&#8217;s
			steps not so much for any pleasure he got from being with
			her as for the pleasure of keeping other people away. Dear
			little Mrs. Spinny was perpetually in a state of humiliation on
			account of his bad manners, and she tried by a very special
			tenderness to make up to Nelly for the remissness of her ungracious
			son.</p>

			<p>Scott was a spare, muscular fellow, good-looking, but with
			a face so set and dark that I used to think it very like the
			castings he sold. He was taciturn and domineering, and Nell
			rather liked to provoke him. Her father was so easy with her
			that she seemed to enjoy being ordered about now and then.
			That night, when every one was praising her and telling her
			how well she sang and how pretty she looked, Scott only said,
			as we came out of the dressing-room:</p>

			<p>&#8220;Have you got your high shoes on?&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;No; but I&#8217;ve got rubbers on over my low ones. Mother
			doesn&#8217;t care.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;Well, you just go back and put &#8217;em on as fast as you can.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Nell made a face at him and ran back, laughing. Her
			mother, fat, comfortable Mrs. Deane, was immensely amused
			at this.</p>

			<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right, Scott,&#8221; she chuckled. &#8220;You can do enough
			more with her than I can. She walks right over me an&#8217; Jud.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Scott grinned. If he was proud of Nelly, the last thing he
			wished to do was to show it. When she came back he began
			to nag again. &#8220;What are you going to do with all those flowers?
			They&#8217;ll freeze stiff as pokers.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;Well, there won&#8217;t none of <em>your</em> flowers freeze, Scott
			Spinny, so there!&#8221; Nell snapped. She had the best of him that
			time, and the Assyrian youths rejoiced. They were most of
			them high-school boys, and the poorest of them had &#8220;chipped
			in&#8221; and sent all the way to Denver for <em>Queen Esther&#8217;s</em> flowers.
			There were bouquets from half a dozen townspeople, too, but
			none from Scott. Scott was a prosperous hardware merchant
			<a class="pagenum" id="page74" title="74">&nbsp;</a>and notoriously penurious, though he saved his face, as the
			boys said, by giving liberally to the church.</p>

			<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no use freezing the fool things, anyhow. You get
			me some newspapers, and I&#8217;ll wrap &#8217;em up.&#8221; Scott took
			from his pocket a folded copy of the Riverbend &#8220;Messenger&#8221;
			and began laboriously to wrap up one of the bouquets.
			When we left the church door he bore three large newspaper
			bundles, carrying them as carefully as if they had been so
			many newly frosted wedding-cakes, and left Nell and me to
			shift for ourselves as we floundered along the snow-burdened
			sidewalk.</p>

			<p>Although it was after midnight, lights were shining from
			many of the little wooden houses, and the roofs and shrubbery
			were so deep in snow that Riverbend looked as if it had
			been tucked down into a warm bed. The companies of
			people, all coming from church, tramping this way and that
			toward their homes and calling &#8220;Good night&#8221; and &#8220;Merry
			Christmas&#8221; as they parted company, all seemed to us very unusual
			and exciting.</p>

			<p>When we got home, Mrs. Deane had a cold supper ready,
			and Jud Deane had already taken off his shoes and fallen to on
			his fried chicken and pie. He was so proud of his pretty
			daughter that he must give her her Christmas presents then
			and there, and he went into the sleeping-chamber behind the
			dining-room and from the depths of his wife&#8217;s closet brought
			out a short sealskin jacket and a round cap and made Nelly
			put them on.</p>

			<p>Mrs. Deane, who sat busy between a plate of spice cake and
			a tray piled with her famous whipped-cream tarts, laughed
			inordinately at his behavior.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Ain&#8217;t he worse than any kid you ever see? He&#8217;s been running
			to that closet like a cat shut away from her kittens. I
			wonder Nell ain&#8217;t caught on before this. I did think he&#8217;d
			make out now to keep &#8217;em till Christmas morning; but he&#8217;s
			never made out to keep anything yet.&#8221;</p>

			<p>That was true enough, and fortunately Jud&#8217;s inability to
			keep anything seemed always to present a highly humorous
			aspect to his wife. Mrs. Deane put her heart into her cooking,
			and said that so long as a man was a good provider she had
			no cause to complain. Other people were not so charitable
			<a class="pagenum" id="page75" title="75">&nbsp;</a>toward Jud&#8217;s failing. I remember how many strictures were
			passed upon that little sealskin and how he was censured for
			his extravagance. But what a public-spirited thing, after all, it
			was for him to do! How, the winter through, we all enjoyed
			seeing Nell skating on the river or running about the town
			with the brown collar turned up about her bright cheeks and
			her hair blowing out from under the round cap! &#8220;No seal,&#8221;
			Mrs. Dow said, &#8220;would have begrudged it to her. Why
			should we?&#8221; This was at the sewing-circle, when the new coat
			was under grave discussion.</p>

			<p>At last Nelly and I got up-stairs and undressed, and the pad
			of Jud&#8217;s slippered feet about the kitchen premises&#8212;where he
			was carrying up from the cellar things that might freeze&#8212;ceased.
			He called &#8220;Good night, daughter,&#8221; from the foot of
			the stairs, and the house grew quiet. But one is not a prima
			donna the first time for nothing, and it seemed as if we could
			not go to bed. Our light must have burned long after every
			other in Riverbend was out. The muslin curtains of Nell&#8217;s bed
			were drawn back; Mrs. Deane had turned down the white
			counterpane and taken off the shams and smoothed the pillows
			for us. But their fair plumpness offered no temptation to
			two such hot young heads. We could not let go of life even
			for a little while. We sat and talked in Nell&#8217;s cozy room, where
			there was a tiny, white fur rug&#8212;the only one in Riverbend&#8212;before
			the bed; and there were white sash curtains, and the
			prettiest little desk and dressing-table I had ever seen. It was a
			warm, gay little room, flooded all day long with sunlight
			from east and south windows that had climbing-roses all
			about them in summer. About the dresser were photographs
			of adoring high-school boys; and one of Guy Franklin, much
			groomed and barbered, in a dress-coat and a boutonnière. I
			never liked to see that photograph there. The home boys
			looked properly modest and bashful on the dresser, but he
			seemed to be staring impudently all the time.</p>

			<p>I knew nothing definite against Guy, but in Riverbend all
			&#8220;traveling-men&#8221; were considered worldly and wicked. He
			traveled for a Chicago dry-goods firm, and our fathers didn&#8217;t
			like him because he put extravagant ideas into our mothers&#8217;
			heads. He had very smooth and nattering ways, and he introduced
			into our simple community a great variety of perfumes
			<a class="pagenum" id="page76" title="76">&nbsp;</a>and scented soaps, and he always reminded me of the merchants
			in Cæsar, who brought into Gaul &#8220;those things which
			effeminate the mind,&#8221; as we translated that delightfully easy
			passage.</p>

			<p>Nell was silting before the dressing-table in her nightgown,
			holding the new fur coat and rubbing her cheek against it,
			when I saw a sudden gleam of tears in her eyes. &#8220;You know,
			Peggy,&#8221; she said in her quick, impetuous way, &#8220;this makes me
			feel bad. I&#8217;ve got a secret from my daddy.&#8221;</p>

			<p>I can see her now, so pink and eager, her brown hair in two
			springy braids down her back, and her eyes shining with tears
			and with something even softer and more tremulous.</p>

			<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m engaged, Peggy,&#8221; she whispered, &#8220;really and truly.&#8221;</p>

			<p>She leaned forward, unbuttoning her nightgown, and there
			on her breast, hung by a little gold chain about her neck, was
			a diamond ring&#8212;Guy Franklin&#8217;s solitaire; every one in Riverbend
			knew it well.</p>

			<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to live in Chicago, and take singing lessons,
			and go to operas, and do all those nice things&#8212;oh, everything!
			I know you don&#8217;t like him, Peggy, but you know you
			<em>are</em> a kid. You&#8217;ll see how it is yourself when you grow up.
			He&#8217;s so <em>different</em> from our boys, and he&#8217;s just terribly in love
			with me. And then, Peggy,&#8221;&#8212;flushing all down over her soft
			shoulders,&#8212;&#8220;I&#8217;m awfully fond of him, too. Awfully.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;Are you, Nell, truly?&#8221; I whispered. She seemed so changed
			to me by the warm light in her eyes and that delicate suffusion
			of color. I felt as I did when I got up early on picnic
			mornings in summer, and saw the dawn come up in the
			breathless sky above the river meadows and make all the cornfields
			golden.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Sure I do, Peggy; don&#8217;t look so solemn. It&#8217;s nothing to
			look that way about, kid. It&#8217;s nice.&#8221; She threw her arms about
			me suddenly and hugged me.</p>

			<p>&#8220;I hate to think about your going so far away from us all,
			Nell.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;Oh, you&#8217;ll love to come and visit me. Just you wait.&#8221;</p>

			<p>She began breathlessly to go over things Guy Franklin had
			told her about Chicago, until I seemed to see it all looming
			up out there under the stars that kept watch over our little
			sleeping town. We had neither of us ever been to a city, but
			<a class="pagenum" id="page77" title="77">&nbsp;</a>we knew what it would be like. We heard it throbbing like
			great engines, and calling to us, that far-away world. Even
			after we had opened the windows and scurried into bed, we
			seemed to feel a pulsation across all the miles of snow. The
			winter silence trembled with it, and the air was full of something
			new that seemed to break over us in soft waves. In that
			snug, warm little bed I had a sense of imminent change and
			danger. I was somehow afraid for Nelly when I heard her
			breathing so quickly beside me, and I put my arm about her
			protectingly as we drifted toward sleep.</p>

			<p class="post_thoughtbreak">In the following spring we were both graduated from the
			Riverbend high school, and I went away to college. My family
			moved to Denver, and during the next four years I heard
			very little of Nelly Deane. My life was crowded with new
			people and new experiences, and I am afraid I held her little
			in mind. I heard indirectly that Jud Deane had lost what little
			property he owned in a luckless venture in Cripple Creek, and
			that he had been able to keep his house in Riverbend only
			through the clemency of his creditors. Guy Franklin had his
			route changed and did not go to Riverbend any more. He
			married the daughter of a rich cattle-man out near Long Pine,
			and ran a dry-goods store of his own. Mrs. Dow wrote me a
			long letter about once a year, and in one of these she told me
			that Nelly was teaching in the sixth grade in the Riverbend
			school.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Dear Nelly does not like teaching very well. The children
			try her, and she is so pretty it seems a pity for her to be tied
			down to uncongenial employment. Scott is still very attentive,
			and I have noticed him look up at the window of Nelly&#8217;s
			room in a very determined way as he goes home to dinner.
			Scott continues prosperous; he has made money during these
			hard times and now owns both our hardware stores. He is
			close, but a very honorable fellow. Nelly seems to hold off,
			but I think Mrs. Spinny has hopes. Nothing would please her
			more. If Scott were more careful about his appearance, it
			would help. He of course gets black about his business, and
			Nelly, you know, is very dainty. People do say his mother
			does his courting for him, she is so eager. If only Scott does
			not turn out hard and penurious like his father! We must all
			<a class="pagenum" id="page78" title="78">&nbsp;</a>have our schooling in this life, but I don&#8217;t want Nelly&#8217;s to be
			too severe. She is a dear girl, and keeps her color.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Mrs. Dow&#8217;s own schooling had been none too easy. Her
			husband had long been crippled with rheumatism, and was
			bitter and faultfinding. Her daughters had married poorly,
			and one of her sons had fallen into evil ways. But her letters
			were always cheerful, and in one of them she gently remonstrated
			with me because I &#8220;seemed inclined to take a sad view
			of life.&#8221;</p>

			<p>In the winter vacation of my senior year I stopped on my
			way home to visit Mrs. Dow. The first thing she told me
			when I got into her old buckboard at the station was that
			&#8220;Scott had at last prevailed,&#8221; and that Nelly was to marry him
			in the spring. As a preliminary step, Nelly was about to join
			the Baptist church. &#8220;Just think, you will be here for her baptizing!
			How that will please Nelly! She is to be immersed to-morrow night.&#8221;</p>

			<p>I met Scott Spinny in the post-office that morning, and he
			gave me a hard grip with one black hand. There was something
			grim and saturnine about his powerful body and
			bearded face and his strong, cold hands. I wondered what
			perverse fate had driven him for eight years to dog the footsteps
			of a girl whose charm was due to qualities naturally distasteful
			to him. It still seems strange to me that in easy-going
			Riverbend, where there were so many boys who could have
			lived contentedly enough with my little grasshopper, it was
			the pushing ant who must have her and all her careless ways.</p>

			<p>By a kind of unformulated etiquette one did not call upon
			candidates for baptism on the day of the ceremony, so I had
			my first glimpse of Nelly that evening. The baptistry was a
			cemented pit directly under the pulpit rostrum, over which
			we had our stage when we sang &#8220;Queen Esther.&#8221; I sat
			through the sermon somewhat nervously. After the minister,
			in his long, black gown, had gone down into the water and
			the choir had finished singing, the door from the dressing-room
			opened, and, led by one of the deacons, Nelly came
			down the steps into the pool. Oh, she looked so little and
			meek and chastened! Her white cashmere robe clung about
			her, and her brown hair was brushed straight back and hung
			in two soft braids from a little head bent humbly. As she
			<a class="pagenum" id="page79" title="79">&nbsp;</a>stepped down into the water I shivered with the cold of it,
			and I remembered sharply how much I had loved her. She
			went down until the water was well above her waist, and
			stood white and small, with her hands crossed on her breast,
			while the minister said the words about being buried with
			Christ in baptism. Then, lying in his arm, she disappeared
			under the dark water. &#8220;It will be like that when she dies,&#8221; I
			thought, and a quick pain caught my heart. The choir began
			to sing &#8220;Washed in the Blood of the Lamb&#8221; as she rose again,
			the door behind the baptistry opened, revealing those three
			dear guardians, Mrs. Dow, Mrs. Freeze, and Mrs. Spinny,
			and she went up into their arms.</p>

			<p>I went to see Nell next day, up in the little room of many
			memories. Such a sad, sad visit! She seemed changed&#8212;a little
			embarrassed and quietly despairing. We talked of many of the
			old Riverbend girls and boys, but she did not mention Guy
			Franklin or Scott Spinny, except to say that her father had got
			work in Scott&#8217;s hardware store. She begged me, putting her
			hands on my shoulders with something of her old impulsiveness,
			to come and stay a few days with her. But I was afraid&#8212;afraid
			of what she might tell me and of what I might say.
			When I sat in that room with all her trinkets, the foolish harvest
			of her girlhood, lying about, and the white curtains
			and the little white rug, I thought of Scott Spinny with positive
			terror and could feel his hard grip on my hand again. I
			made the best excuse I could about having to hurry on to
			Denver; but she gave me one quick look, and her eyes ceased
			to plead. I saw that she understood me perfectly. We had
			known each other so well. Just once, when I got up to go and
			had trouble with my veil, she laughed her old merry laugh
			and told me there were some things I would never learn, for
			all my schooling.</p>

			<p>The next day, when Mrs. Dow drove me down to the
			station to catch the morning train for Denver, I saw Nelly
			hurrying to school with several books under her arm. She
			had been working up her lessons at home, I thought. She was
			never quick at her books, dear Nell.</p>

			<hr class="thoughtbreak" />

			<p class="post_thoughtbreak">It was ten years before I again visited Riverbend. I had
			been in Rome for a long time, and had fallen into bitter
			<a class="pagenum" id="page80" title="80">&nbsp;</a>homesickness. One morning, sitting among the dahlias and
			asters that bloom so bravely upon those gigantic heaps of
			earth-red ruins that were once the palaces of the Cæsars, I
			broke the seal of one of Mrs. Dow&#8217;s long yearly letters. It
			brought so much sad news that I resolved then and there to
			go home to Riverbend, the only place that had ever really
			been home to me. Mrs. Dow wrote me that her husband,
			after years of illness, had died in the cold spell last March. &#8220;So
			good and patient toward the last,&#8221; she wrote, &#8220;and so afraid
			of giving extra trouble.&#8221; There was another thing she saved
			until the last. She wrote on and on, dear woman, about new
			babies and village improvements, as if she could not bear to
			tell me; and then it came:</p>

			<p>&#8220;You will be sad to hear that two months ago our dear
			Nelly left us. It was a terrible blow to us all. I cannot write
			about it yet, I fear. I wake up every morning feeling that I
			ought to go to her. She went three days after her little boy
			was born. The baby is a fine child and will live, I think, in
			spite of everything. He and her little girl, now eight years old,
			whom she named Margaret, after you, have gone to Mrs.
			Spinny&#8217;s. She loves them more than if they were her own. It
			seems as if already they had made her quite young again. I
			wish you could see Nelly&#8217;s children.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Ah, that was what I wanted, to see Nelly&#8217;s children! The
			wish came aching from my heart along with the bitter homesick
			tears; along with a quick, torturing recollection that
			flashed upon me, as I looked about and tried to collect myself,
			of how we two had sat in our sunny seat in the corner of the
			old bare school-room one September afternoon and learned
			the names of the seven hills together. In that place, at that
			moment, after so many years, how it all came back to me&#8212;the
			warm sun on my back, the chattering girl beside me, the
			curly hair, the laughing yellow eyes, the stubby little finger on
			the page! I felt as if even then, when we sat in the sun with
			our heads together, it was all arranged, written out like a
			story, that at this moment I should be sitting among the
			crumbling bricks and drying grass, and she should be lying in
			the place I knew so well, on that green hill far away.</p>

			<hr class="thoughtbreak" />

			<p class="post_thoughtbreak">Mrs. Dow sat with her Christmas sewing in the familiar
			<a class="pagenum" id="page81" title="81">&nbsp;</a>sitting-room, where the carpet and the wall-paper and the
			table-cover had all faded into soft, dull colors, and even the
			chromo of Hagar and Ishmael had been toned to the sobriety
			of age. In the bay-window the tall wire flower-stand still bore
			its little terraces of potted plants, and the big fuchsia and the
			Martha Washington geranium had blossomed for Christmas-tide.
			Mrs. Dow herself did not look greatly changed to me.
			Her hair, thin ever since I could remember it, was now quite
			white, but her spare, wiry little person had all its old activity,
			and her eyes gleamed with the old friendliness behind her
			silver-bowed glasses. Her gray house-dress seemed just like
			those she used to wear when I ran in after school to take her
			angel-food cake down to the church supper.</p>

			<p>The house sat on a hill, and from behind the geraniums I
			could see pretty much all of Riverbend, tucked down in the
			soft snow, and the air above was full of big, loose flakes, falling
			from a gray sky which betokened settled weather. Indoors
			the hard-coal burner made a tropical temperature, and glowed
			a warm orange from its isinglass sides. We sat and visited, the
			two of us, with a great sense of comfort and completeness. I
			had reached Riverbend only that morning, and Mrs. Dow,
			who had been haunted by thoughts of shipwreck and suffering
			upon wintry seas, kept urging me to draw nearer to the
			fire and suggesting incidental refreshment. We had chattered
			all through the winter morning and most of the afternoon,
			taking up one after another of the Riverbend girls and boys,
			and agreeing that we had reason to be well satisfied with most
			of them. Finally, after a long pause in which I had listened to
			the contented ticking of the clock and the crackle of the coal,
			I put the question I had until then held back:</p>

			<p>&#8220;And now, Mrs. Dow, tell me about the one we loved best
			of all. Since I got your letter I&#8217;ve thought of her every day.
			Tell me all about Scott and Nelly.&#8221;</p>

			<p>The tears flashed behind her glasses, and she smoothed the
			little pink bag on her knee.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Well, dear, I&#8217;m afraid Scott proved to be a hard man, like
			his father. But we must remember that Nelly always had Mrs.
			Spinny. I never saw anything like the love there was between
			those two. After Nelly lost her own father and mother, she
			looked to Mrs. Spinny for everything. When Scott was too
			<a class="pagenum" id="page82" title="82">&nbsp;</a>unreasonable, his mother could &#8217;most always prevail upon
			him. She never lifted a hand to fight her own battles with
			Scott&#8217;s father, but she was never afraid to speak up for Nelly.
			And then Nelly took great comfort of her little girl. Such a
			lovely child!&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;Had she been very ill before the little baby came?&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;No, Margaret; I&#8217;m afraid &#8217;t was all because they had the
			wrong doctor. I feel confident that either Doctor Tom or
			Doctor Jones could have brought her through. But, you see,
			Scott had offended them both, and they&#8217;d stopped trading at
			his store, so he would have young Doctor Fox, a boy just out
			of college and a stranger. He got scared and didn&#8217;t know
			what to do. Mrs. Spinny felt he wasn&#8217;t doing right, so she
			sent for Mrs. Freeze and me. It seemed like Nelly had got
			discouraged. Scott would move into their big new house before
			the plastering was dry, and though &#8217;t was summer, she
			had taken a terrible cold that seemed to have drained her, and
			she took no interest in fixing the place up. Mrs. Spinny had
			been down with her back again and wasn&#8217;t able to help, and
			things was just anyway. We won&#8217;t talk about that, Margaret; I
			think &#8217;t would hurt Mrs. Spinny to have you know. She
			nearly died of mortification when she sent for us, and blamed
			her poor back. We did get Nelly fixed up nicely before she
			died. I prevailed upon Doctor Tom to come in at the last, and
			it &#8217;most broke his heart. &#8216;Why, Mis&#8217; Dow,&#8217; he said, &#8216;if you&#8217;d
			only have come and told me how &#8217;t was, I&#8217;d have come and
			carried her right off in my arms.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;Oh, Mrs. Dow,&#8221; I cried, &#8220;then it needn&#8217;t have been?&#8221;</p>

			<p>Mrs. Dow dropped her needle and clasped her hands
			quickly. &#8220;We mustn&#8217;t look at it that way, dear,&#8221; she said tremulously
			and a little sternly; &#8220;we mustn&#8217;t let ourselves. We
			must just feel that our Lord wanted her <em>then</em>, and took her to
			Himself. When it was all over, she did look so like a child of
			God, young and trusting, like she did on her baptizing night,
			you remember?&#8221;</p>

			<p>I felt that Mrs. Dow did not want to talk any more about
			Nelly then, and, indeed, I had little heart to listen; so I told
			her I would go for a walk, and suggested that I might stop at
			Mrs. Spinny&#8217;s to see the children.</p>

			<p>Mrs. Dow looked up thoughtfully at the clock. &#8220;I doubt if
			<a class="pagenum" id="page83" title="83">&nbsp;</a>you&#8217;ll find little Margaret there now. It&#8217;s half-past four, and
			she&#8217;ll have been out of school an hour and more. She&#8217;ll be
			most likely coasting on Lupton&#8217;s Hill. She usually makes for it
			with her sled the minute she is out of the school-house door.
			You know, it&#8217;s the old hill where you all used to slide. If you
			stop in at the church about six o&#8217;clock, you&#8217;ll likely find Mrs.
			Spinny there with the baby. I promised to go down and help
			Mrs. Freeze finish up the tree, and Mrs. Spinny said she&#8217;d run
			in with the baby, if &#8217;t wasn&#8217;t too bitter. She won&#8217;t leave him
			alone with the Swede girl. She&#8217;s like a young woman with
			her first.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Lupton&#8217;s Hill was at the other end of town, and when I got
			there the dusk was thickening, drawing blue shadows over the
			snowy fields. There were perhaps twenty children creeping up
			the hill or whizzing down the packed sled-track. When I had
			been watching them for some minutes, I heard a lusty shout,
			and a little red sled shot past me into the deep snow-drift
			beyond. The child was quite buried for a moment, then she
			struggled out and stood dusting the snow from her short coat
			and red woolen comforter. She wore a brown fur cap, which
			was too big for her and of an old-fashioned shape, such as
			girls wore long ago, but I would have known her without the
			cap. Mrs. Dow had said a beautiful child, and there would
			not be two like this in Riverbend. She was off before I had
			time to speak to her, going up the hill at a trot, her sturdy
			little legs plowing through the trampled snow. When she
			reached the top she never paused to take breath, but threw
			herself upon her sled and came down with a whoop that was
			quenched only by the deep drift at the end.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Are you Margaret Spinny?&#8221; I asked as she struggled out in
			a cloud of snow.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Yes, &#8217;m.&#8221; She approached me with frank curiosity, pulling
			her little sled behind her. &#8220;Are you the strange lady staying at
			Mrs. Dow&#8217;s?&#8221; I nodded, and she began to look my clothes
			over with respectful interest.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Your grandmother is to be at the church at six o&#8217;clock,
			isn&#8217;t she?&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;Yes, &#8217;m.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;Well, suppose we walk up there now. It&#8217;s nearly six, and
			all the other children are going home.&#8221; She hesitated, and
			<a class="pagenum" id="page84" title="84">&nbsp;</a>looked up at the faintly gleaming track on the hill-slope. &#8220;Do
			you want another slide? Is that it?&#8221; I asked.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Do you mind?&#8221; she asked shyly.</p>

			<p>&#8220;No. I&#8217;ll wait for you. Take your time; don&#8217;t run.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Two little boys were still hanging about the slide, and they
			cheered her as she came down, her comforter streaming in the
			wind.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; she announced, getting up out of the drift, &#8220;I&#8217;ll
			show you where the church is.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;Shall I tie your comforter again?&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;No, &#8217;m, thanks. I&#8217;m plenty warm.&#8221; She put her mittened
			hand confidingly in mine and trudged along beside me.</p>

			<p>Mrs. Dow must have heard us tramping up the snowy steps
			of the church, for she met us at the door. Every one had gone
			except the old ladies. A kerosene lamp flickered over the
			Sunday-school chart, with the lesson-picture of the Wise
			Men, and the little barrel-stove threw out a deep glow over
			the three white heads that bent above the baby. There the
			three friends sat, patting him, and smoothing his dress, and
			playing with his hands, which made theirs look so brown.</p>

			<p>&#8220;You ain&#8217;t seen nothing finer in all your travels,&#8221; said Mrs.
			Spinny, and they all laughed.</p>

			<p>They showed me his full chest and how strong his back
			was; had me feel the golden fuzz on his head, and made him
			look at me with his round, bright eyes. He laughed and
			reared himself in my arms as I took him up and held him
			close to me. He was so warm and tingling with life, and he
			had the flush of new beginnings, of the new morning and the
			new rose. He seemed to have come so lately from his mother&#8217;s
			heart! It was as if I held her youth and all her young joy.
			As I put my cheek down against his, he spied a pink flower in
			my hat, and making a gleeful sound, he lunged at it with both
			fists.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t let him spoil it,&#8221; murmured Mrs. Spinny. &#8220;He loves
			color so&#8212;like Nelly.&#8221;</p>

			<h4>I</h4>

			<p class="first_paragraph">The Trans-continental Express swung along the
			windings of the Sand River Valley, and in the rear seat of
			the observation car a young man sat greatly at his ease, not in
			the least discomfited by the fierce sunlight which beat in upon
			his brown face and neck and strong back. There was a look of
			relaxation and of great passivity about his broad shoulders,
			which seemed almost too heavy until he stood up and squared
			them. He wore a pale flannel shirt and a blue silk necktie with
			loose ends. His trousers were wide and belted at the waist,
			and his short sack-coat hung open. His heavy shoes had seen
			good service. His reddish-brown hair, like his clothes, had a
			foreign cut. He had deep-set, dark blue eyes under heavy reddish
			eyebrows. His face was kept clean only by close shaving,
			and even the sharpest razor left a glint of yellow in the
			smooth brown of his skin. His teeth and the palms of his
			hands were very white. His head, which looked hard and
			stubborn, lay indolently in the green cushion of the wicker
			chair, and as he looked out at the ripe summer country a
			teasing, not unkindly smile played over his lips. Once, as he
			basked thus comfortably, a quick light flashed in his eyes,
			curiously dilating the pupils, and his mouth became a hard,
			straight line, gradually relaxing into its former smile of rather
			kindly mockery. He told himself, apparently, that there was
			no point in getting excited; and he seemed a master hand at
			taking his ease when he could. Neither the sharp whistle of
			the locomotive nor the brakeman&#8217;s call disturbed him. It was
			not until after the train had stopped that he rose, put on a
			Panama hat, took from the rack a small valise and a flute-case,
			and stepped deliberately to the station platform. The baggage
			was already unloaded, and the stranger presented a check for
			a battered sole-leather steamer-trunk.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Can you keep it here for a day or two?&#8221; he asked the
			agent. &#8220;I may send for it, and I may not.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;Depends on whether you like the country, I suppose?&#8221; demanded
			the agent in a challenging tone.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Just so.&#8221;</p>

			<p><a class="pagenum" id="page86" title="86">&nbsp;</a>The agent shrugged his shoulders, looked scornfully at the
			small trunk, which was marked &#8220;N.E.,&#8221; and handed out a
			claim check without further comment. The stranger watched
			him as he caught one end of the trunk and dragged it into the
			express room. The agent&#8217;s manner seemed to remind him of
			something amusing. &#8220;Doesn&#8217;t seem to be a very big place,&#8221; he
			remarked, looking about.</p>

			<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s big enough for us,&#8221; snapped the agent, as he banged
			the trunk into a corner.</p>

			<p>That remark, apparently, was what Nils Ericson had
			wanted. He chuckled quietly as he took a leather strap from
			his pocket and swung his valise around his shoulder. Then he
			settled his Panama securely on his head, turned up his trousers,
			tucked the flute-case under his arm, and started off across
			the fields. He gave the town, as he would have said, a wide
			berth, and cut through a great fenced pasture, emerging,
			when he rolled under the barbed wire at the farther corner,
			upon a white dusty road which ran straight up from the river
			valley to the high prairies, where the ripe wheat stood yellow
			and the tin roofs and weather-cocks were twinkling in the
			fierce sunlight. By the time Nils had done three miles, the sun
			was sinking and the farm-wagons on their way home from
			town came rattling by, covering him with dust and making
			him sneeze. When one of the farmers pulled up and offered to
			give him a lift, he clambered in willingly. The driver was a
			thin, grizzled old man with a long lean neck and a foolish sort
			of beard, like a goat&#8217;s. &#8220;How fur ye goin&#8217;?&#8221; he asked, as he
			clucked to his horses and started off.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Do you go by the Ericson place?&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;Which Ericson?&#8221; The old man drew in his reins as if he
			expected to stop again.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Preacher Ericson&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;Oh, the Old Lady Ericson&#8217;s!&#8221; He turned and looked at
			Nils. &#8220;La, me! If you&#8217;re goin&#8217; out there you might &#8217;a&#8217; rid out
			in the automobile. That&#8217;s a pity, now. The Old Lady Ericson
			was in town with her auto. You might &#8217;a&#8217; heard it snortin&#8217;
			anywhere about the post-office er the butcher-shop.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;Has she a motor?&#8221; asked the stranger absently.</p>

			<p>&#8220;&#8216;Deed an&#8217; she has! She runs into town every night about
			this time for her mail and meat for supper. Some folks say
			<a class="pagenum" id="page87" title="87">&nbsp;</a>she&#8217;s afraid her auto won&#8217;t get exercise enough, but I say
			that&#8217;s jealousy.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;Aren&#8217;t there any other motors about here?&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;Oh, yes! we have fourteen in all. But nobody else gets
			around like the Old Lady Ericson. She&#8217;s out, rain er shine,
			over the whole county, chargin&#8217; into town and out amongst
			her farms, an&#8217; up to her sons&#8217; places. Sure you ain&#8217;t goin&#8217; to
			the wrong place?&#8221; He craned his neck and looked at Nils&#8217;
			flute-case with eager curiosity. &#8220;The old woman ain&#8217;t got any
			piany that I knows on. Olaf, he has a grand. His wife&#8217;s musical;
			took lessons in Chicago.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going up there to-morrow,&#8221; said Nils imperturbably.
			He saw that the driver took him for a piano-tuner.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Oh, I see!&#8221; The old man screwed up his eyes mysteriously.
			He was a little dashed by the stranger&#8217;s non-communicativeness,
			but he soon broke out again.</p>

			<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m one o&#8217; Mis&#8217; Ericson&#8217;s tenants. Look after one of her
			places. I did own the place myself oncet, but I lost it a while
			back, in the bad years just after the World&#8217;s Fair. Just as well,
			too, I say. Lets you out o&#8217; payin&#8217; taxes. The Ericsons do own
			most of the county now. I remember the old preacher&#8217;s
			fav&#8217;rite text used to be, &#8216;To them that hath shall be given.&#8217;
			They&#8217;ve spread something wonderful&#8212;run over this here
			country like bindweed. But I ain&#8217;t one that begretches it to
			&#8217;em. Folks is entitled to what they kin git; and they&#8217;re hustlers.
			Olaf, he&#8217;s in the Legislature now, and a likely man fur
			Congress. Listen, if that ain&#8217;t the old woman comin&#8217; now.
			Want I should stop her?&#8221;</p>

			<p>Nils shook his head. He heard the deep chug-chug of a
			motor vibrating steadily in the clear twilight behind them.
			The pale lights of the car swam over the hill, and the old man
			slapped his reins and turned clear out of the road, ducking his
			head at the first of three angry snorts from behind. The motor
			was running at a hot, even speed, and passed without turning
			an inch from its course. The driver was a stalwart woman
			who sat at ease in the front seat and drove her car bareheaded.
			She left a cloud of dust and a trail of gasoline behind
			her. Her tenant threw back his head and sneezed.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Whew! I sometimes say I&#8217;d as lief be <em>before</em> Mrs. Ericson as
			behind her. She does beat all! Nearly seventy, and never lets
			<a class="pagenum" id="page88" title="88">&nbsp;</a>another soul touch that car. Puts it into commission herself
			every morning, and keeps it tuned up by the hitch-bar all day.
			I never stop work for a drink o&#8217; water that I don&#8217;t hear her
			a-churnin&#8217; up the road. I reckon her darter-in-laws never sets
			down easy nowadays. Never know when she&#8217;ll pop in. Mis&#8217;
			Otto, she says to me: &#8216;We&#8217;re so afraid that thing&#8217;ll blow up
			and do Ma some injury yet, she&#8217;s so turrible venturesome.&#8217;
			Says I: &#8216;I wouldn&#8217;t stew, Mis&#8217; Otto; the old lady&#8217;ll drive that
			car to the funeral of every darter-in-law she&#8217;s got.&#8217; That was
			after the old woman had jumped a turrible bad culvert.&#8221;</p>

			<p>The stranger heard vaguely what the old man was saying.
			Just now he was experiencing something very much like
			homesickness, and he was wondering what had brought it
			about. The mention of a name or two, perhaps; the rattle of a
			wagon along a dusty road; the rank, resinous smell of sunflowers
			and ironweed, which the night damp brought up
			from the draws and low places; perhaps, more than all, the
			dancing lights of the motor that had plunged by. He squared
			his shoulders with a comfortable sense of strength.</p>

			<p>The wagon, as it jolted westward, climbed a pretty steady
			upgrade. The country, receding from the rough river valley,
			swelled more and more gently, as if it had been smoothed out
			by the wind. On one of the last of the rugged ridges, at the
			end of a branch road, stood a grim square house with a tin
			roof and double porches. Behind the house stretched a row of
			broken, wind-racked poplars, and down the hill-slope to the
			left straggled the sheds and stables. The old man stopped his
			horses where the Ericsons&#8217; road branched across a dry sand
			creek that wound about the foot of the hill.</p>

			<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the old lady&#8217;s place. Want I should drive in?&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;No, thank you. I&#8217;ll roll out here. Much obliged to you.
			Good night.&#8221;</p>

			<p>His passenger stepped down over the front wheel, and the
			old man drove on reluctantly, looking back as if he would like
			to see how the stranger would be received.</p>

			<p>As Nils was crossing the dry creek he heard the restive
			tramp of a horse coming toward him down the hill. Instantly
			he flashed out of the road and stood behind a thicket of wild
			plum bushes that grew in the sandy bed. Peering through the
			dusk, he saw a light horse, under tight rein, descending the
			<a class="pagenum" id="page89" title="89">&nbsp;</a>hill at a sharp walk. The rider was a slender woman&#8212;barely
			visible against the dark hillside&#8212;wearing an old-fashioned
			derby hat and a long riding-skirt. She sat lightly in the saddle,
			with her chin high, and seemed to be looking into the distance.
			As she passed the plum thicket her horse snuffed the air
			and shied. She struck him, pulling him in sharply, with an
			angry exclamation, &#8220;<em>Blázne!</em>&#8221; in Bohemian. Once in the main
			road, she let him out into a lope, and they soon emerged
			upon the crest of high land, where they moved along the skyline,
			silhouetted against the band of faint color that lingered
			in the west. This horse and rider, with their free, rhythmical
			gallop, were the only moving things to be seen on the face of
			the flat country. They seemed, in the last sad light of evening,
			not to be there accidentally, but as an inevitable detail of the
			landscape.</p>

			<p>Nils watched them until they had shrunk to a mere moving
			speck against the sky, then he crossed the sand creek and
			climbed the hill. When he reached the gate the front of the
			house was dark, but a light was shining from the side windows.
			The pigs were squealing in the hog corral, and Nils
			could see a tall boy, who carried two big wooden buckets,
			moving about among them. Half way between the barn and
			the house, the windmill wheezed lazily. Following the path
			that ran around to the back porch, Nils stopped to look
			through the screen door into the lamp-lit kitchen. The
			kitchen was the largest room in the house; Nils remembered
			that his older brothers used to give dances there when he was
			a boy. Beside the stove stood a little girl with two light yellow
			braids and a broad, flushed face, peering anxiously into a
			frying-pan. In the dining-room beyond, a large, broad-shouldered
			woman was moving about the table. She walked
			with an active, springy step. Her face was heavy and florid,
			almost without wrinkles, and her hair was black at seventy.
			Nils felt proud of her as he watched her deliberate activity;
			never a momentary hesitation, or a movement that did not
			tell. He waited until she came out into the kitchen and,
			brushing the child aside, took her place at the stove. Then he
			tapped on the screen door and entered.</p>

			<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s nobody but Nils, Mother. I expect you weren&#8217;t looking
			for me.&#8221;</p>

			<p><a class="pagenum" id="page90" title="90">&nbsp;</a>Mrs. Ericson turned away from the stove and stood staring
			at him. &#8220;Bring the lamp, Hilda, and let me look.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Nils laughed and unslung his valise. &#8220;What&#8217;s the matter,
			Mother? Don&#8217;t you know me?&#8221;</p>

			<p>Mrs. Ericson put down the lamp. &#8220;You must be Nils. You
			don&#8217;t look very different, anyway.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;Nor you, Mother. You hold your own. Don&#8217;t you wear
			glasses yet?&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;Only to read by. Where&#8217;s your trunk, Nils?&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;Oh, I left that in town. I thought it might not be convenient
			for you to have company so near threshing-time.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be foolish, Nils.&#8221; Mrs. Ericson turned back to the
			stove. &#8220;I don&#8217;t thresh now. I hitched the wheat land onto the
			next farm and have a tenant. Hilda, take some hot water up to
			the company room, and go call little Eric.&#8221;</p>

			<p>The tow-haired child, who had been standing in mute
			amazement, took up the tea-kettle and withdrew, giving Nils
			a long, admiring look from the door of the kitchen stairs.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Who&#8217;s the youngster?&#8221; Nils asked, dropping down on the
			bench behind the kitchen stove.</p>

			<p>&#8220;One of your Cousin Henrik&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;How long has Cousin Henrik been dead?&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;Six years. There are two boys. One stays with Peter and
			one with Anders. Olaf is their guardeen.&#8221;</p>

			<p>There was a clatter of pails on the porch, and a tall, lanky
			boy peered wonderingly in through the screen door. He had
			a fair, gentle face and big gray eyes, and wisps of soft yellow
			hair hung down under his cap. Nils sprang up and pulled him
			into the kitchen, hugging him and slapping him on the shoulders.
			&#8220;Well, if it isn&#8217;t my kid! Look at the size of him! Don&#8217;t
			you know me, Eric?&#8221;</p>

			<p>The boy reddened under his sunburn and freckles, and
			hung his head. &#8220;I guess it&#8217;s Nils,&#8221; he said shyly.</p>

			<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a good guesser,&#8221; laughed Nils, giving the lad&#8217;s
			hand a swing. To himself he was thinking: &#8220;That&#8217;s why the
			little girl looked so friendly. He&#8217;s taught her to like me. He
			was only six when I went away, and he&#8217;s remembered for
			twelve years.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Eric stood fumbling with his cap and smiling. &#8220;You look
			just like I thought you would,&#8221; he ventured.</p>

			<p><a class="pagenum" id="page91" title="91">&nbsp;</a>&#8220;Go wash your hands, Eric,&#8221; called Mrs. Ericson. &#8220;I&#8217;ve got
			cob corn for supper, Nils. You used to like it. I guess you
			don&#8217;t get much of that in the old country. Here&#8217;s Hilda; she&#8217;ll
			take you up to your room. You&#8217;ll want to get the dust off you
			before you eat.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Mrs. Ericson went into the dining-room to lay another
			plate, and the little girl came up and nodded to Nils as if to
			let him know that his room was ready. He put out his hand
			and she took it, with a startled glance up at his face. Little
			Eric dropped his towel, threw an arm about Nils and one
			about Hilda, gave them a clumsy squeeze, and then stumbled
			out to the porch.</p>

			<p>During supper Nils heard exactly how much land each of
			his eight grown brothers farmed, how their crops were coming
			on, and how much live stock they were feeding. His
			mother watched him narrowly as she talked. &#8220;You&#8217;ve got
			better looking, Nils,&#8221; she remarked abruptly, whereupon he
			grinned and the children giggled. Eric, although he was eighteen
			and as tall as Nils, was always accounted a child, being
			the last of so many sons. His face seemed childlike, too, Nils
			thought, and he had the open, wandering eyes of a little boy.
			All the others had been men at his age.</p>

			<p>After supper Nils went out to the front porch and sat down
			on the step to smoke a pipe. Mrs. Ericson drew a rocking-chair
			up near him and began to knit busily. It was one of the
			few old-world customs she had kept up, for she could not
			bear to sit with idle hands.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s little Eric, Mother?&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s helping Hilda with the dishes. He does it of his own
			will; I don&#8217;t like a boy to be too handy about the house.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;He seems like a nice kid.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s very obedient.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Nils smiled a little in the dark. It was just as well to shift
			the line of conversation. &#8220;What are you knitting there,
			Mother?&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;Baby stockings. The boys keep me busy.&#8221; Mrs. Ericson
			chuckled and clicked her needles.</p>

			<p>&#8220;How many grandchildren have you?&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;Only thirty-one now. Olaf lost his three. They were sickly,
			like their mother.&#8221;</p>

			<p><a class="pagenum" id="page92" title="92">&nbsp;</a>&#8220;I supposed he had a second crop by this time!&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;His second wife has no children. She&#8217;s too proud. She
			tears about on horseback all the time. But she&#8217;ll get caught up
			with, yet. She sets herself very high, though nobody knows
			what for. They were low enough Bohemians she came of. I
			never thought much of Bohemians; always drinking.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Nils puffed away at his pipe in silence, and Mrs. Ericson
			knitted on. In a few moments she added grimly: &#8220;She was
			down here to-night, just before you came. She&#8217;d like to quarrel
			with me and come between me and Olaf, but I don&#8217;t give
			her the chance. I suppose you&#8217;ll be bringing a wife home
			some day.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know. I&#8217;ve never thought much about it.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;Well, perhaps it&#8217;s best as it is,&#8221; suggested Mrs. Ericson
			hopefully. &#8220;You&#8217;d never be contented tied down to the land.
			There was roving blood in your father&#8217;s family, and it&#8217;s
			come out in you. I expect your own way of life suits you
			best.&#8221; Mrs. Ericson had dropped into a blandly agreeable
			tone which Nils well remembered. It seemed to amuse him
			a good deal and his white teeth flashed behind his pipe.
			His mother&#8217;s strategies had always diverted him, even when
			he was a boy&#8212;they were so flimsy and patent, so illy proportioned
			to her vigor and force. &#8220;They&#8217;ve been waiting
			to see which way I&#8217;d jump,&#8221; he reflected. He felt that Mrs.
			Ericson was pondering his case deeply as she sat clicking her
			needles.</p>

			<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t suppose you&#8217;ve ever got used to steady work,&#8221; she
			went on presently. &#8220;Men ain&#8217;t apt to if they roam around too
			long. It&#8217;s a pity you didn&#8217;t come back the year after the
			World&#8217;s Fair. Your father picked up a good bit of land cheap
			then, in the hard times, and I expect maybe he&#8217;d have give
			you a farm. It&#8217;s too bad you put off comin&#8217; back so long, for
			I always thought he meant to do something by you.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Nils laughed and shook the ashes out of his pipe. &#8220;I&#8217;d have
			missed a lot if I had come back then. But I&#8217;m sorry I didn&#8217;t
			get back to see father.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;Well, I suppose we have to miss things at one end or the
			other. Perhaps you are as well satisfied with your own doings,
			now, as you&#8217;d have been with a farm,&#8221; said Mrs. Ericson reassuringly.</p>

			<p><a class="pagenum" id="page93" title="93">&nbsp;</a>&#8220;Land&#8217;s a good thing to have,&#8221; Nils commented, as he lit
			another match and sheltered it with his hand.</p>

			<p>His mother looked sharply at his face until the match
			burned out. &#8220;Only when you stay on it!&#8221; she hastened to say.</p>

			<p>Eric came round the house by the path just then, and Nils
			rose, with a yawn. &#8220;Mother, if you don&#8217;t mind, Eric and I will
			take a little tramp before bed-time. It will make me sleep.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;Very well; only don&#8217;t stay long. I&#8217;ll sit up and wait for you.
			I like to lock up myself.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Nils put his hand on Eric&#8217;s shoulder, and the two tramped
			down the hill and across the sand creek into the dusty highroad
			beyond. Neither spoke. They swung along at an even
			gait, Nils puffing at his pipe. There was no moon, and the
			white road and the wide fields lay faint in the starlight. Over
			everything was darkness and thick silence, and the smell of
			dust and sunflowers. The brothers followed the road for a
			mile or more without finding a place to sit down. Finally Nils
			perched on a stile over the wire fence, and Eric sat on the
			lower step.</p>

			<p>&#8220;I began to think you never would come back, Nils,&#8221; said
			the boy softly.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t I promise you I would?&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;Yes; but people don&#8217;t bother about promises they make to
			babies. Did you really know you were going away for good
			when you went to Chicago with the cattle that time?&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;I thought it very likely, if I could make my way.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see how you did it, Nils. Not many fellows could.&#8221;
			Eric rubbed his shoulder against his brother&#8217;s knee.</p>

			<p>&#8220;The hard thing was leaving home&#8212;you and father. It was
			easy enough, once I got beyond Chicago. Of course I got
			awful homesick; used to cry myself to sleep. But I&#8217;d burned
			my bridges.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;You had always wanted to go, hadn&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;Always. Do you still sleep in our little room? Is that cottonwood
			still by the window?&#8221;</p>

			<p>Eric nodded eagerly and smiled up at his brother in the
			gray darkness.</p>

			<p>&#8220;You remember how we always said the leaves were whispering
			when they rustled at night? Well, they always whispered
			to me about the sea. Sometimes they said names out of
			<a class="pagenum" id="page94" title="94">&nbsp;</a>the geography books. In a high wind they had a desperate
			sound, like something trying to tear loose.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;How funny, Nils,&#8221; said Eric dreamily, resting his chin on
			his hand. &#8220;That tree still talks like that, and &#8217;most always it
			talks to me about you.&#8221;</p>

			<p>They sat a while longer, watching the stars. At last Eric
			whispered anxiously: &#8220;Hadn&#8217;t we better go back now?
			Mother will get tired waiting for us.&#8221; They rose and took a
			short cut home, through the pasture.</p>

			<h4>II</h4>

			<p>The next morning Nils woke with the first flood of light
			that came with dawn. The white-plastered walls of his room
			reflected the glare that shone through the thin window-shades,
			and he found it impossible to sleep. He dressed hurriedly
			and slipped down the hall and up the back stairs to the
			half-story room which he used to share with his little brother.
			Eric, in a skimpy night-shirt, was sitting on the edge of the
			bed, rubbing his eyes, his pale yellow hair standing up in tufts
			all over his head. When he saw Nils, he murmured something
			confusedly and hustled his long legs into his trousers. &#8220;I
			didn&#8217;t expect you&#8217;d be up so early, Nils,&#8221; he said, as his head
			emerged from his blue shirt.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Oh, you thought I was a dude, did you?&#8221; Nils gave him a
			playful tap which bent the tall boy up like a clasp-knife. &#8220;See
			here; I must teach you to box.&#8221; Nils thrust his hands into his
			pockets and walked about. &#8220;You haven&#8217;t changed things much
			up here. Got most of my old traps, haven&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

			<p>He took down a bent, withered piece of sapling that hung
			over the dresser. &#8220;If this isn&#8217;t the stick Lou Sandberg killed
			himself with!&#8221;</p>

			<p>The boy looked up from his shoe-lacing.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Yes; you never used to let me play with that. Just how did
			he do it, Nils? You were with father when he found Lou,
			weren&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;Yes. Father was going off to preach somewhere, and, as
			we drove along, Lou&#8217;s place looked sort of forlorn, and we
			thought we&#8217;d stop and cheer him up. When we found him
			father said he&#8217;d been dead a couple days. He&#8217;d tied a piece of
			<a class="pagenum" id="page95" title="95">&nbsp;</a>binding twine round his neck, made a noose in each end,
			fixed the nooses over the ends of a bent stick, and let the stick
			spring straight; strangled himself.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;What made him kill himself such a silly way?&#8221;</p>

			<p>The simplicity of the boy&#8217;s question set Nils laughing. He
			clapped little Eric on the shoulder. &#8220;What made him such a
			silly as to kill himself at all, I should say!&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;Oh, well! But his hogs had the cholera, and all up and
			died on him, didn&#8217;t they?&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;Sure they did; but he didn&#8217;t have cholera; and there were
			plenty of hogs left in the world, weren&#8217;t there?&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;Well, but, if they weren&#8217;t his, how could they do him any
			good?&#8221; Eric asked, in astonishment.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Oh, scat! He could have had lots of fun with other people&#8217;s
			hogs. He was a chump, Lou Sandberg. To kill yourself
			for a pig&#8212;think of that, now!&#8221; Nils laughed all the way
			downstairs, and quite embarrassed little Eric, who fell to
			scrubbing his face and hands at the tin basin. While he was
			patting his wet hair at the kitchen looking-glass, a heavy tread
			sounded on the stairs. The boy dropped his comb. &#8220;Gracious,
			there&#8217;s Mother. We must have talked too long.&#8221; He hurried
			out to the shed, slipped on his overalls, and disappeared with
			the milking-pails.</p>

			<p>Mrs. Ericson came in, wearing a clean white apron, her
			black hair shining from the application of a wet brush.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Good morning, Mother. Can&#8217;t I make the fire for you?&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;No, thank you, Nils. It&#8217;s no trouble to make a cob fire,
			and I like to manage the kitchen stove myself.&#8221; Mrs. Ericson
			paused with a shovel full of ashes in her hand. &#8220;I expect you
			will be wanting to see your brothers as soon as possible. I&#8217;ll
			take you up to Anders&#8217; place this morning. He&#8217;s threshing,
			and most of our boys are over there.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;Will Olaf be there?&#8221;</p>

			<p>Mrs. Ericson went on taking out the ashes, and spoke between
			shovels. &#8220;No; Olaf&#8217;s wheat is all in, put away in his
			new barn. He got six thousand bushel this year. He&#8217;s going to
			town to-day to get men to finish roofing his barn.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;So Olaf is building a new barn?&#8221; Nils asked absently.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Biggest one in the county, and almost done. You&#8217;ll likely
			be here for the barn-raising. He&#8217;s going to have a supper and
			<a class="pagenum" id="page96" title="96">&nbsp;</a>a dance as soon as everybody&#8217;s done threshing. Says it keeps
			the voters in a good humor. I tell him that&#8217;s all nonsense; but
			Olaf has a long head for politics.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;Does Olaf farm all Cousin Henrik&#8217;s land?&#8221;</p>

			<p>Mrs. Ericson frowned as she blew into the faint smoke
			curling up about the cobs. &#8220;Yes; he holds it in trust for the
			children, Hilda and her brothers. He keeps strict account of
			everything he raises on it, and puts the proceeds out at compound
			interest for them.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Nils smiled as he watched the little flames shoot up. The
			door of the back stairs opened, and Hilda emerged, her arms
			behind her, buttoning up her long gingham apron as she
			came. He nodded to her gaily, and she twinkled at him out of
			her little blue eyes, set far apart over her wide cheek-bones.</p>

			<p>&#8220;There, Hilda, you grind the coffee&#8212;and just put in an
			extra handful; I expect your Cousin Nils likes his strong,&#8221; said
			Mrs. Ericson, as she went out to the shed.</p>

			<p>Nils turned to look at the little girl, who gripped the
			coffee-grinder between her knees and ground so hard that her
			two braids bobbed and her face flushed under its broad spattering
			of freckles. He noticed on her middle finger something
			that had not been there last night, and that had evidently
			been put on for company: a tiny gold ring with a clumsily set
			garnet stone. As her hand went round and round he touched
			the ring with the tip of his finger, smiling.</p>

			<p>Hilda glanced toward the shed door through which Mrs.
			Ericson had disappeared. &#8220;My Cousin Clara gave me that,&#8221;
			she whispered bashfully. &#8220;She&#8217;s Cousin Olaf&#8217;s wife.&#8221;</p>

			<h4>III</h4>

			<p>Mrs. Olaf Ericson&#8212;Clara Vavrika, as many people still
			called her&#8212;was moving restlessly about her big bare house
			that morning. Her husband had left for the county town before
			his wife was out of bed&#8212;her lateness in rising was one
			of the many things the Ericson family had against her. Clara
			seldom came downstairs before eight o&#8217;clock, and this morning
			she was even later, for she had dressed with unusual care.
			She put on, however, only a tight-fitting black dress, which
			people thereabouts thought very plain. She was a tall, dark
			<a class="pagenum" id="page97" title="97">&nbsp;</a>woman of thirty, with a rather sallow complexion and a touch
			of dull salmon red in her cheeks, where the blood seemed to
			burn under her brown skin. Her hair, parted evenly above her
			low forehead, was so black that there were distinctly blue
			lights in it. Her black eyebrows were delicate half-moons and
			her lashes were long and heavy. Her eyes slanted a little, as if
			she had a strain of Tartar or gypsy blood, and were sometimes
			full of fiery determination and sometimes dull and opaque.
			Her expression was never altogether amiable; was often, indeed,
			distinctly sullen, or, when she was animated, sarcastic.
			She was most attractive in profile, for then one saw to advantage
			her small, well-shaped head and delicate ears, and
			felt at once that here was a very positive, if not an altogether
			pleasing, personality.</p>

			<p>The entire management of Mrs. Olaf&#8217;s household devolved
			upon her aunt, Johanna Vavrika, a superstitious, doting
			woman of fifty. When Clara was a little girl her mother died,
			and Johanna&#8217;s life had been spent in ungrudging service to her
			niece. Clara, like many self-willed and discontented persons,
			was really very apt, without knowing it, to do as other people
			told her, and to let her destiny be decided for her by intelligences
			much below her own. It was her Aunt Johanna who
			had humored and spoiled her in her girlhood, who had got
			her off to Chicago to study piano, and who had finally persuaded
			her to marry Olaf Ericson as the best match she would
			be likely to make in that part of the country. Johanna Vavrika
			had been deeply scarred by smallpox in the old country. She
			was short and fat, homely and jolly and sentimental. She was
			so broad, and took such short steps when she walked, that her
			brother, Joe Vavrika, always called her his duck. She adored
			her niece because of her talent, because of her good looks and
			masterful ways, but most of all because of her selfishness.</p>

			<p>Clara&#8217;s marriage with Olaf Ericson was Johanna&#8217;s particular
			triumph. She was inordinately proud of Olaf&#8217;s position, and
			she found a sufficiently exciting career in managing Clara&#8217;s
			house, in keeping it above the criticism of the Ericsons, in
			pampering Olaf to keep him from finding fault with his wife,
			and in concealing from every one Clara&#8217;s domestic infelicities.
			While Clara slept of a morning, Johanna Vavrika was bustling
			about, seeing that Olaf and the men had their breakfast, and
			<a class="pagenum" id="page98" title="98">&nbsp;</a>that the cleaning or the butter-making or the washing was
			properly begun by the two girls in the kitchen. Then, at about
			eight o&#8217;clock, she would take Clara&#8217;s coffee up to her, and
			chat with her while she drank it, telling her what was going
			on in the house. Old Mrs. Ericson frequently said that her
			daughter-in-law would not know what day of the week it was
			if Johanna did not tell her every morning. Mrs. Ericson despised
			and pitied Johanna, but did not wholly dislike her. The
			one thing she hated in her daughter-in-law above everything
			else was the way in which Clara could come it over people. It
			enraged her that the affairs of her son&#8217;s big, barnlike house
			went on as well as they did, and she used to feel that in this
			world we have to wait over-long to see the guilty punished.
			&#8220;Suppose Johanna Vavrika died or got sick?&#8221; the old lady used
			to say to Olaf. &#8220;Your wife wouldn&#8217;t know where to look for
			her own dish-cloth.&#8221; Olaf only shrugged his shoulders. The
			fact remained that Johanna did not die, and, although Mrs.
			Ericson often told her she was looking poorly, she was never
			ill. She seldom left the house, and she slept in a little room off
			the kitchen. No Ericson, by night or day, could come prying
			about there to find fault without her knowing it. Her one
			weakness was that she was an incurable talker, and she sometimes
			made trouble without meaning to.</p>

			<p>This morning Clara was tying a wine-colored ribbon about
			her throat when Johanna appeared with her coffee. After putting
			the tray on a sewing-table, she began to make Clara&#8217;s
			bed, chattering the while in Bohemian.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Well, Olaf got off early, and the girls are baking. I&#8217;m going
			down presently to make some poppy-seed bread for Olaf.
			He asked for prune preserves at breakfast, and I told him I
			was out of them, and to bring some prunes and honey and
			cloves from town.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Clara poured her coffee. &#8220;Ugh! I don&#8217;t see how men can eat
			so much sweet stuff. In the morning, too!&#8221;</p>

			<p>Her aunt chuckled knowingly. &#8220;Bait a bear with honey, as
			we say in the old country.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;Was he cross?&#8221; her niece asked indifferently.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Olaf? Oh, no! He was in fine spirits. He&#8217;s never cross if
			you know how to take him. I never knew a man to make so
			little fuss about bills. I gave him a list of things to get a yard
			<a class="pagenum" id="page99" title="99">&nbsp;</a>long, and he didn&#8217;t say a word; just folded it up and put it in
			his pocket.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;I can well believe he didn&#8217;t say a word,&#8221; Clara remarked
			with a shrug. &#8220;Some day he&#8217;ll forget how to talk.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;Oh, but they say he&#8217;s a grand speaker in the Legislature.
			He knows when to keep quiet. That&#8217;s why he&#8217;s got such influence
			in politics. The people have confidence in him.&#8221; Johanna
			beat up a pillow and held it under her fat chin while
			she slipped on the case. Her niece laughed.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Maybe we could make people believe we were wise,
			Aunty, if we held our tongues. Why did you tell Mrs. Ericson
			that Norman threw me again last Saturday and turned my
			foot? She&#8217;s been talking to Olaf.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Johanna fell into great confusion. &#8220;Oh, but, my precious,
			the old lady asked for you, and she&#8217;s always so angry if I can&#8217;t
			give an excuse. Anyhow, she needn&#8217;t talk; she&#8217;s always tearing
			up something with that motor of hers.&#8221;</p>

			<p>When her aunt clattered down to the kitchen, Clara went
			to dust the parlor. Since there was not much there to dust,
			this did not take very long. Olaf had built the house new for
			her before their marriage, but her interest in furnishing it had
			been short-lived. It went, indeed, little beyond a bath-tub and
			her piano. They had disagreed about almost every other article
			of furniture, and Clara had said she would rather have her
			house empty than full of things she didn&#8217;t want. The house
			was set in a hillside, and the west windows of the parlor
			looked out above the kitchen yard thirty feet below. The east
			windows opened directly into the front yard. At one of the
			latter, Clara, while she was dusting, heard a low whistle. She
			did not turn at once, but listened intently as she drew her
			cloth slowly along the round of a chair. Yes, there it was:</p>

			<blockquote class="call-out"><p>&#8220;<em>I dreamt that I dwelt in ma-a-arble halls,</em>&#8221;</p></blockquote>

			<p>She turned and saw Nils Ericson laughing in the sunlight,
			his hat in his hand, just outside the window. As she crossed
			the room he leaned against the wire screen. &#8220;Aren&#8217;t you at all
			surprised to see me, Clara Vavrika?&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;No; I was expecting to see you. Mother Ericson telephoned
			Olaf last night that you were here.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Nils squinted and gave a long whistle. &#8220;Telephoned? That
			<a class="pagenum" id="page100" title="100">&nbsp;</a>must have been while Eric and I were out walking. Isn&#8217;t she
			enterprising? Lift this screen, won&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

			<p>Clara lifted the screen, and Nils swung his leg across the
			window-sill. As he stepped into the room she said: &#8220;You
			didn&#8217;t think you were going to get ahead of your mother, did
			you?&#8221;</p>

			<p>He threw his hat on the piano. &#8220;Oh, I do sometimes. You
			see, I&#8217;m ahead of her now. I&#8217;m supposed to be in Anders&#8217;
			wheat-field. But, as we were leaving, Mother ran her car into
			a soft place beside the road and sank up to the hubs. While
			they were going for horses to pull her out, I cut away behind
			the stacks and escaped.&#8221; Nils chuckled. Clara&#8217;s dull eyes lit up
			as she looked at him admiringly.</p>

			<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve got them guessing already. I don&#8217;t know what your
			mother said to Olaf over the telephone, but he came back
			looking as if he&#8217;d seen a ghost, and he didn&#8217;t go to bed until a
			dreadful hour&#8212;ten o&#8217;clock, I should think. He sat out on the
			porch in the dark like a graven image. It had been one of his
			talkative days, too.&#8221; They both laughed, easily and lightly, like
			people who have laughed a great deal together; but they remained
			standing.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Anders and Otto and Peter looked as if they had seen
			ghosts, too, over in the threshing-field. What&#8217;s the matter
			with them all?&#8221;</p>

			<p>Clara gave him a quick, searching look. &#8220;Well, for one
			thing, they&#8217;ve always been afraid you have the other will.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Nils looked interested. &#8220;The other will?&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;Yes. A later one. They knew your father made another,
			but they never knew what he did with it. They almost tore
			the old house to pieces looking for it. They always suspected
			that he carried on a clandestine correspondence with you, for
			the one thing he would do was to get his own mail himself.
			So they thought he might have sent the new will to you for
			safekeeping. The old one, leaving everything to your mother,
			was made long before you went away, and it&#8217;s understood
			among them that it cuts you out&#8212;that she will leave all the
			property to the others. Your father made the second will to
			prevent that. I&#8217;ve been hoping you had it. It would be such
			fun to spring it on them.&#8221; Clara laughed mirthfully, a thing
			she did not often do now.</p>

			<p><a class="pagenum" id="page101" title="101">&nbsp;</a>Nils shook his head reprovingly. &#8220;Come, now, you&#8217;re malicious.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;No, I&#8217;m not. But I&#8217;d like something to happen to stir them
			all up, just for once. There never was such a family for having
			nothing ever happen to them but dinner and threshing. I&#8217;d
			almost be willing to die, just to have a funeral. <em>You</em> wouldn&#8217;t
			stand it for three weeks.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Nils bent over the piano and began pecking at the keys
			with the finger of one hand. &#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t? My dear young
			lady, how do you know what I can stand? <em>You</em> wouldn&#8217;t wait
			to find out.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Clara flushed darkly and frowned. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t believe you
			would ever come back&#8212;&#8221; she said defiantly.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Eric believed I would, and he was only a baby when I
			went away. However, all&#8217;s well that ends well, and I haven&#8217;t
			come back to be a skeleton at the feast. We mustn&#8217;t quarrel.
			Mother will be here with a search-warrant pretty soon.&#8221; He
			swung round and faced her, thrusting his hands into his coat
			pockets. &#8220;Come, you ought to be glad to see me, if you want
			something to happen. I&#8217;m something, even without a will. We
			can have a little fun, can&#8217;t we? I think we can!&#8221;</p>

			<p>She echoed him, &#8220;I think we can!&#8221; They both laughed and
			their eyes sparkled. Clara Vavrika looked ten years younger
			than when she had put the velvet ribbon about her throat that
			morning.</p>

			<p>&#8220;You know, I&#8217;m so tickled to see mother,&#8221; Nils went on. &#8220;I
			didn&#8217;t know I was so proud of her. A regular pile-driver.
			How about little pigtails, down at the house? Is Olaf doing
			the square thing by those children?&#8221;</p>

			<p>Clara frowned pensively. &#8220;Olaf has to do something that
			looks like the square thing, now that he&#8217;s a public man!&#8221; She
			glanced drolly at Nils. &#8220;But he makes a good commission out
			of it. On Sundays they all get together here and figure. He
			lets Peter and Anders put in big bills for the keep of the two
			boys, and he pays them out of the estate. They are always
			having what they call accountings. Olaf gets something out of
			it, too. I don&#8217;t know just how they do it, but it&#8217;s entirely a
			family matter, as they say. And when the Ericsons say that&#8212;&#8221;
			Clara lifted her eyebrows.</p>

			<p>Just then the angry <em>honk-honk</em> of an approaching motor
			<a class="pagenum" id="page102" title="102">&nbsp;</a>sounded from down the road. Their eyes met and they began
			to laugh. They laughed as children do when they can not contain
			themselves, and can not explain the cause of their mirth
			to grown people, but share it perfectly together. When Clara
			Vavrika sat down at the piano after he was gone, she felt that
			she had laughed away a dozen years. She practised as if the
			house were burning over her head.</p>

			<p>When Nils greeted his mother and climbed into the front
			seat of the motor beside her, Mrs. Ericson looked grim, but
			she made no comment upon his truancy until she had turned
			her car and was retracing her revolutions along the road that
			ran by Olaf&#8217;s big pasture. Then she remarked dryly:</p>

			<p>&#8220;If I were you I wouldn&#8217;t see too much of Olaf&#8217;s wife while
			you are here. She&#8217;s the kind of woman who can&#8217;t see much of
			men without getting herself talked about. She was a good
			deal talked about before he married her.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;Hasn&#8217;t Olaf tamed her?&#8221; Nils asked indifferently.</p>

			<p>Mrs. Ericson shrugged her massive shoulders. &#8220;Olaf don&#8217;t
			seem to have much luck, when it comes to wives. The first
			one was meek enough, but she was always ailing. And this
			one has her own way. He says if he quarreled with her she&#8217;d
			go back to her father, and then he&#8217;d lose the Bohemian vote.
			There are a great many Bohunks in this district. But when
			you find a man under his wife&#8217;s thumb you can always be sure
			there&#8217;s a soft spot in him somewhere.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Nils thought of his own father, and smiled. &#8220;She brought
			him a good deal of money, didn&#8217;t she, besides the Bohemian
			vote?&#8221;</p>

			<p>Mrs. Ericson sniffed. &#8220;Well, she has a fair half section in her
			own name, but I can&#8217;t see as that does Olaf much good. She
			will have a good deal of property some day, if old Vavrika
			don&#8217;t marry again. But I don&#8217;t consider a saloonkeeper&#8217;s
			money as good as other people&#8217;s money.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Nils laughed outright. &#8220;Come, Mother, don&#8217;t let your prejudices
			carry you that far. Money&#8217;s money. Old Vavrika&#8217;s a
			mighty decent sort of saloonkeeper. Nothing rowdy about
			him.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Mrs. Ericson spoke up angrily: &#8220;Oh, I know you always
			stood up for them! But hanging around there when you were
			a boy never did you any good, Nils, nor any of the other boys
			<a class="pagenum" id="page103" title="103">&nbsp;</a>who went there. There weren&#8217;t so many after her when she
			married Olaf, let me tell you. She knew enough to grab her
			chance.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Nils settled back in his seat. &#8220;Of course I liked to go there,
			Mother, and you were always cross about it. You never took
			the trouble to find out that it was the one jolly house in this
			country for a boy to go to. All the rest of you were working
			yourselves to death, and the houses were mostly a mess, full
			of babies and washing and flies. Oh, it was all right&#8212;I understand
			that; but you are young only once, and I happened
			to be young then. Now, Vavrika&#8217;s was always jolly. He played
			the violin, and I used to take my flute, and Clara played the
			piano, and Johanna used to sing Bohemian songs. She always
			had a big supper for us&#8212;herrings and pickles and poppyseed
			bread, and lots of cake and preserves. Old Joe had been
			in the army in the old country, and he could tell lots of good
			stories. I can see him cutting bread, at the head of the table,
			now. I don&#8217;t know what I&#8217;d have done when I was a kid if it
			hadn&#8217;t been for the Vavrikas, really.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;And all the time he was taking money that other people
			had worked hard in the fields for,&#8221; Mrs. Ericson observed.</p>

			<p>&#8220;So do the circuses, Mother, and they&#8217;re a good thing.
			People ought to get fun for some of their money. Even
			father liked old Joe.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;Your father,&#8221; Mrs. Ericson said grimly, &#8220;liked everybody.&#8221;</p>

			<p>As they crossed the sand creek and turned into her own
			place, Mrs. Ericson observed, &#8220;There&#8217;s Olaf&#8217;s buggy. He&#8217;s
			stopped on his way from town.&#8221; Nils shook himself and prepared
			to greet his brother, who was waiting on the porch.</p>

			<p>Olaf was a big, heavy Norwegian, slow of speech and
			movement. His head was large and square, like a block of
			wood. When Nils, at a distance, tried to remember what his
			brother looked like, he could recall only his heavy head, high
			forehead, large nostrils, and pale-blue eyes, set far apart.
			Olaf&#8217;s features were rudimentary: the thing one noticed was
			the face itself, wide and flat and pale, devoid of any expression,
			betraying his fifty years as little as it betrayed anything
			else, and powerful by reason of its very stolidness. When Olaf
			shook hands with Nils he looked at him from under his light
			eyebrows, but Nils felt that no one could ever say what that
			<a class="pagenum" id="page104" title="104">&nbsp;</a>pale look might mean. The one thing he had always felt in
			Olaf was a heavy stubbornness, like the unyielding stickiness
			of wet loam against the plow. He had always found Olaf the
			most difficult of his brothers.</p>

			<p>&#8220;How do you do, Nils? Expect to stay with us long?&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;Oh, I may stay forever,&#8221; Nils answered gaily. &#8220;I like this
			country better than I used to.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s been some work put into it since you left,&#8221; Olaf
			remarked.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Exactly. I think it&#8217;s about ready to live in now&#8212;and I&#8217;m
			about ready to settle down.&#8221; Nils saw his brother lower his
			big head. (&#8220;Exactly like a bull,&#8221; he thought.) &#8220;Mother&#8217;s been
			persuading me to slow down now, and go in for farming,&#8221; he
			went on lightly.</p>

			<p>Olaf made a deep sound in his throat. &#8220;Farming ain&#8217;t
			learned in a day,&#8221; he brought out, still looking at the ground.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Oh, I know! But I pick things up quickly.&#8221; Nils had not
			meant to antagonize his brother, and he did not know now
			why he was doing it. &#8220;Of course,&#8221; he went on, &#8220;I shouldn&#8217;t
			expect to make a big success, as you fellows have done. But
			then, I&#8217;m not ambitious. I won&#8217;t want much. A little land,
			and some cattle, maybe.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Olaf still stared at the ground, his head down. He wanted
			to ask Nils what he had been doing all these years, that he
			didn&#8217;t have a business somewhere he couldn&#8217;t afford to leave;
			why he hadn&#8217;t more pride than to come back with only a little
			sole-leather trunk to show for himself, and to present himself
			as the only failure in the family. He did not ask one of these
			questions, but he made them all felt distinctly.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Humph!&#8221; Nils thought. &#8220;No wonder the man never talks,
			when he can butt his ideas into you like that without ever
			saying a word. I suppose he uses that kind of smokeless powder
			on his wife all the time. But I guess she has her innings.&#8221;
			He chuckled, and Olaf looked up. &#8220;Never mind me, Olaf. I
			laugh without knowing why, like little Eric. He&#8217;s another
			cheerful dog.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;Eric,&#8221; said Olaf slowly, &#8220;is a spoiled kid. He&#8217;s just let his
			mother&#8217;s best cow go dry because he don&#8217;t milk her right. I
			was hoping you&#8217;d take him away somewhere and put him
			into business. If he don&#8217;t do any good among strangers, he
			<a class="pagenum" id="page105" title="105">&nbsp;</a>never will.&#8221; This was a long speech for Olaf, and as he finished
			it he climbed into his buggy.</p>

			<p>Nils shrugged his shoulders. &#8220;Same old tricks,&#8221; he thought.
			&#8220;Hits from behind you every time. What a whale of a man!&#8221;
			He turned and went round to the kitchen, where his mother
			was scolding little Eric for letting the gasoline get low.</p>

			<h4>IV</h4>

			<p>Joe Vavrika&#8217;s saloon was not in the county-seat, where Olaf
			and Mrs. Ericson did their trading, but in a cheerfuller place,
			a little Bohemian settlement which lay at the other end of the
			county, ten level miles north of Olaf&#8217;s farm. Clara rode up to
			see her father almost every day. Vavrika&#8217;s house was, so to
			speak, in the back yard of his saloon. The garden between the
			two buildings was inclosed by a high board fence as tight as a
			partition, and in summer Joe kept beer-tables and wooden
			benches among the gooseberry bushes under his little cherry
			tree. At one of these tables Nils Ericson was seated in the late
			afternoon, three days after his return home. Joe had gone in
			to serve a customer, and Nils was lounging on his elbows,
			looking rather mournfully into his half-emptied pitcher, when
			he heard a laugh across the little garden. Clara, in her riding-habit,
			was standing at the back door of the house, under the
			grapevine trellis that old Joe had grown there long ago. Nils
			rose.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Come out and keep your father and me company. We&#8217;ve
			been gossiping all afternoon. Nobody to bother us but the
			flies.&#8221;</p>

			<p>She shook her head. &#8220;No, I never come out here any
			more. Olaf doesn&#8217;t like it. I must live up to my position, you
			know.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;You mean to tell me you never come out and chat with
			the boys, as you used to? He <em>has</em> tamed you! Who keeps up
			these flower-beds?&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;I come out on Sundays, when father is alone, and read the
			Bohemian papers to him. But I am never here when the bar is
			open. What have you two been doing?&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;Talking, as I told you. I&#8217;ve been telling him about my
			travels. I find I can&#8217;t talk much at home, not even to Eric.&#8221;</p>

			<p><a class="pagenum" id="page106" title="106">&nbsp;</a>Clara reached up and poked with her riding-whip at a
			white moth that was fluttering in the sunlight among the vine
			leaves. &#8220;I suppose you will never tell me about all those
			things.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;Where can I tell them? Not in Olaf&#8217;s house, certainly.
			What&#8217;s the matter with our talking here?&#8221; He pointed persuasively
			with his hat to the bushes and the green table, where
			the flies were singing lazily above the empty beer-glasses.</p>

			<p>Clara shook her head weakly. &#8220;No, it wouldn&#8217;t do. Besides,
			I am going now.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m on Eric&#8217;s mare. Would you be angry if I overtook
			you?&#8221;</p>

			<p>Clara looked back and laughed. &#8220;You might try and see. I
			can leave you if I don&#8217;t want you. Eric&#8217;s mare can&#8217;t keep up
			with Norman.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Nils went into the bar and attempted to pay his score. Big
			Joe, six feet four, with curly yellow hair and mustache,
			clapped him on the shoulder. &#8220;Not a God-damn a your
			money go in my drawer, you hear? Only next time you bring
			your flute, te-te-te-te-te-ty.&#8221; Joe wagged his fingers in imitation
			of the flute-player&#8217;s position. &#8220;My Clara, she come all-a-time
			Sundays an&#8217; play for me. She not like to play at Ericson&#8217;s
			place.&#8221; He shook his yellow curls and laughed. &#8220;Not a God-damn
			a fun at Ericson&#8217;s. You come a Sunday. You like-a fun.
			No forget de flute.&#8221; Joe talked very rapidly and always tumbled
			over his English. He seldom spoke it to his customers,
			and had never learned much.</p>

			<p>Nils swung himself into the saddle and trotted to the west
			end of the village, where the houses and gardens scattered
			into prairie-land and the road turned south. Far ahead of
			him, in the declining light, he saw Clara Vavrika&#8217;s slender figure,
			loitering on horseback. He touched his mare with the
			whip, and shot along the white, level road, under the reddening
			sky. When he overtook Olaf&#8217;s wife he saw that she had
			been crying. &#8220;What&#8217;s the matter, Clara Vavrika?&#8221; he asked
			kindly.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Oh, I get blue sometimes. It was awfully jolly living there
			with father. I wonder why I ever went away.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Nils spoke in a low, kind tone that he sometimes used with
			women: &#8220;That&#8217;s what I&#8217;ve been wondering these many years.
			<a class="pagenum" id="page107" title="107">&nbsp;</a>You were the last girl in the country I&#8217;d have picked for a wife
			for Olaf. What made you do it, Clara?&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;I suppose I really did it to oblige the neighbors&#8221;&#8212;Clara
			tossed her head. &#8220;People were beginning to wonder.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;To wonder?&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;Yes&#8212;why I didn&#8217;t get married. I suppose I didn&#8217;t like to
			keep them in suspense. I&#8217;ve discovered that most girls marry
			out of consideration for the neighborhood.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Nils bent his head toward her and his white teeth flashed.
			&#8220;I&#8217;d have gambled that one girl I knew would say, &#8216;Let the
			neighborhood be damned.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

			<p>Clara shook her head mournfully. &#8220;You see, they have it on
			you, Nils; that is, if you&#8217;re a woman. They say you&#8217;re beginning
			to go off. That&#8217;s what makes us get married: we can&#8217;t
			stand the laugh.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Nils looked sidewise at her. He had never seen her head
			droop before. Resignation was the last thing he would have
			expected of her. &#8220;In your case, there wasn&#8217;t something else?&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;Something else?&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;I mean, you didn&#8217;t do it to spite somebody? Somebody
			who didn&#8217;t come back?&#8221;</p>

			<p>Clara drew herself up. &#8220;Oh, I never thought you&#8217;d come
			back. Not after I stopped writing to you, at least. <em>That</em> was all
			over, long before I married Olaf.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;It never occurred to you, then, that the meanest thing you
			could do to me was to marry Olaf?&#8221;</p>

			<p>Clara laughed. &#8220;No; I didn&#8217;t know you were so fond of
			Olaf.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Nils smoothed his horse&#8217;s mane with his glove. &#8220;You know,
			Clara Vavrika, you are never going to stick it out. You&#8217;ll cut
			away some day, and I&#8217;ve been thinking you might as well cut
			away with me.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Clara threw up her chin. &#8220;Oh, you don&#8217;t know me as well
			as you think. I won&#8217;t cut away. Sometimes, when I&#8217;m with
			father, I feel like it. But I can hold out as long as the Ericsons
			can. They&#8217;ve never got the best of me yet, and one can live, so
			long as one isn&#8217;t beaten. If I go back to father, it&#8217;s all up with
			Olaf in politics. He knows that, and he never goes much beyond
			sulking. I&#8217;ve as much wit as the Ericsons. I&#8217;ll never leave
			them unless I can show them a thing or two.&#8221;</p>

			<p><a class="pagenum" id="page108" title="108">&nbsp;</a>&#8220;You mean unless you can come it over them?&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;Yes&#8212;unless I go away with a man who is cleverer than
			they are, and who has more money.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Nils whistled. &#8220;Dear me, you are demanding a good deal.
			The Ericsons, take the lot of them, are a bunch to beat. But I
			should think the excitement of tormenting them would have
			worn off by this time.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;It has, I&#8217;m afraid,&#8221; Clara admitted mournfully.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Then why don&#8217;t you cut away? There are more amusing
			games than this in the world. When I came home I thought it
			might amuse me to bully a few quarter sections out of the
			Ericsons; but I&#8217;ve almost decided I can get more fun for my
			money somewhere else.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Clara took in her breath sharply. &#8220;Ah, you have got the
			other will! That was why you came home!&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;No, it wasn&#8217;t. I came home to see how you were getting
			on with Olaf.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Clara struck her horse with the whip, and in a bound she
			was far ahead of him. Nils dropped one word, &#8220;Damn!&#8221; and
			whipped after her; but she leaned forward in her saddle and
			fairly cut the wind. Her long riding-skirt rippled in the still
			air behind her. The sun was just sinking behind the stubble in
			a vast, clear sky, and the shadows drew across the fields so
			rapidly that Nils could scarcely keep in sight the dark figure
			on the road. When he overtook her he caught her horse by
			the bridle. Norman reared, and Nils was frightened for her;
			but Clara kept her seat.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Let me go, Nils Ericson!&#8221; she cried. &#8220;I hate you more than
			any of them. You were created to torture me, the whole tribe
			of you&#8212;to make me suffer in every possible way.&#8221;</p>

			<p>She struck her horse again and galloped away from him.
			Nils set his teeth and looked thoughtful. He rode slowly
			home along the deserted road, watching the stars come out in
			the clear violet sky. They flashed softly into the limpid heavens,
			like jewels let fall into clear water. They were a reproach,
			he felt, to a sordid world. As he turned across the sand creek,
			he looked up at the North Star and smiled, as if there were an
			understanding between them. His mother scolded him for
			being late for supper.</p>

			<h4><a class="pagenum" id="page109" title="109">&nbsp;</a>V</h4>

			<p>On Sunday afternoon Joe Vavrika, in his shirt-sleeves
			and carpet-slippers, was sitting in his garden, smoking a long-tasseled
			porcelain pipe with a hunting scene painted on
			the bowl. Clara sat under the cherry tree, reading aloud to
			him from the weekly Bohemian papers. She had worn a
			white muslin dress under her riding-habit, and the leaves of
			the cherry tree threw a pattern of sharp shadows over her
			skirt. The black cat was dozing in the sunlight at her feet, and
			Joe&#8217;s dachshund was scratching a hole under the scarlet geraniums
			and dreaming of badgers. Joe was filling his pipe for
			the third time since dinner, when he heard a knocking on the
			fence. He broke into a loud guffaw and unlatched the little
			door that led into the street. He did not call Nils by name,
			but caught him by the hand and dragged him in. Clara stiffened
			and the color deepened under her dark skin. Nils, too,
			felt a little awkward. He had not seen her since the night
			when she rode away from him and left him alone on the level
			road between the fields. Joe dragged him to the wooden
			bench beside the green table.</p>

			<p>&#8220;You bring de flute,&#8221; he cried, tapping the leather case under
			Nils&#8217; arm. &#8220;Ah, das-a good! Now we have some liddle fun
			like old times. I got somet&#8217;ing good for you.&#8221; Joe shook his
			finger at Nils and winked his blue eyes, a bright clear eye, full
			of fire, though the tiny blood-vessels on the ball were always a
			little distended. &#8220;I got somet&#8217;ing for you from&#8221;&#8212;he paused
			and waved his hand&#8212;&#8220;Hongarie. You know Hongarie? You
			wait!&#8221; He pushed Nils down on the bench, and went through
			the back door of his saloon.</p>

			<p>Nils looked at Clara, who sat frigidly with her white
			skirts drawn tight about her. &#8220;He didn&#8217;t tell you he had asked
			me to come, did he? He wanted a party and proceeded to
			arrange it. Isn&#8217;t he fun? Don&#8217;t be cross; let&#8217;s give him a good
			time.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Clara smiled and shook out her skirt. &#8220;Isn&#8217;t that like father?
			And he has sat here so meekly all day. Well, I won&#8217;t pout. I&#8217;m
			glad you came. He doesn&#8217;t have very many good times now
			<a class="pagenum" id="page110" title="110">&nbsp;</a>any more. There are so few of his kind left. The second generation
			are a tame lot.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Joe came back with a flask in one hand and three wine-glasses
			caught by the stems between the fingers of the other.
			These he placed on the table with an air of ceremony, and,
			going behind Nils, held the flask between him and the sun,
			squinting into it admiringly. &#8220;You know dis, Tokai? A great
			friend of mine, he bring dis to me, a present out of Hongarie.
			You know how much it cost, dis wine? Chust so much what it
			weigh in gold. Nobody but de nobles drink him in Bohemie.
			Many, many years I save him up, dis Tokai.&#8221; Joe whipped out
			his official cork-screw and delicately removed the cork. &#8220;De
			old man die what bring him to me, an&#8217; dis wine he lay on his
			belly in my cellar an&#8217; sleep. An&#8217; now,&#8221; carefully pouring out
			the heavy yellow wine, &#8220;an&#8217; now he wake up; and maybe he
			wake us up, too!&#8221; He carried one of the glasses to his daughter
			and presented it with great gallantry.</p>

			<p>Clara shook her head, but, seeing her father&#8217;s disappointment,
			relented. &#8220;You taste it first. I don&#8217;t want so much.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Joe sampled it with a beatific expression, and turned to
			Nils. &#8220;You drink him slow, dis wine. He very soft, but he go
			down hot. You see!&#8221;</p>

			<p>After a second glass Nils declared that he couldn&#8217;t take any
			more without getting sleepy. &#8220;Now get your fiddle, Vavrika,&#8221;
			he said as he opened his flute-case.</p>

			<p>But Joe settled back in his wooden rocker and wagged his
			big carpet-slipper. &#8220;No-no-no-no-no-no-no! No play fiddle
			now any more: too much ache in de finger,&#8221; waving them,
			&#8220;all-a-time rheumatiz. You play de flute, te-tety-te-tety-te. Bohemie
			songs.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve forgotten all the Bohemian songs I used to play with
			you and Johanna. But here&#8217;s one that will make Clara pout.
			You remember how her eyes used to snap when we called her
			the Bohemian Girl?&#8221; Nils lifted his flute and began &#8220;When
			Other Lips and Other Hearts,&#8221; and Joe hummed the air in a
			husky baritone, waving his carpet-slipper. &#8220;Oh-h-h, das-a fine
			music,&#8221; he cried, clapping his hands as Nils finished. &#8220;Now
			&#8216;Marble Halls, Marble Halls&#8217;! Clara, you sing him.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Clara smiled and leaned back in her chair, beginning softly:</p>

			<blockquote class="poem">
				<p><a class="pagenum" id="page111" title="111">&nbsp;</a>&#8220;<em>I dreamt that I dwelt in ma-a-arble halls,</em></p>
				<p><em>With vassals and serfs at my knee,</em>&#8221;</p>
			</blockquote>

			<p class="continued_paragraph">and Joe hummed like a big bumble-bee.</p>

			<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s one more you always played,&#8221; Clara said quietly;
			&#8220;I remember that best.&#8221; She locked her hands over her knee
			and began &#8220;The Heart Bowed Down,&#8221; and sang it through
			without groping for the words. She was singing with a good
			deal of warmth when she came to the end of the old song:</p>

			<blockquote class="poem">
				<p>&#8220;<em>For memory is the only friend</em></p>
				<p><em>That grief can call its own.</em>&#8221;</p>
			</blockquote>

			<p>Joe flashed out his red silk handkerchief and blew his nose,
			shaking his head. &#8220;No-no-no-no-no-no-no! Too sad, too sad!
			I not like-a dat. Play quick somet&#8217;ing gay now.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Nils put his lips to the instrument, and Joe lay back in his
			chair, laughing and singing, &#8220;Oh, Evelina, Sweet Evelina!&#8221;
			Clara laughed, too. Long ago, when she and Nils went to
			high school, the model student of their class was a very
			homely girl in thick spectacles. Her name was Evelina Oleson;
			she had a long, swinging walk which somehow suggested the
			measure of that song, and they used mercilessly to sing it at
			her.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Dat ugly Oleson girl, she teach in de school,&#8221; Joe gasped,
			&#8220;an&#8217; she still walk chust like dat, yup-a, yup-a, yup-a, chust
			like a camel she go! Now, Nils, we have some more li&#8217;l drink.
			Oh, yes-yes-yes-yes-yes-yes-<em>yes!</em> Dis time you haf to drink, and
			Clara she haf to, so she show she not jealous. So, we all drink
			to your girl. You not tell her name, eh? No-no-no, I no make
			you tell. She pretty, eh? She make good sweetheart? I bet!&#8221;
			Joe winked and lifted his glass. &#8220;How soon you get married?&#8221;</p>

			<p>Nils screwed up his eyes. &#8220;That I don&#8217;t know. When she
			says.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Joe threw out his chest. &#8220;Das-a way boys talks. No way for
			mans. Mans say, &#8216;You come to de church, an&#8217; get a hurry on
			you.&#8217; Das-a way mans talks.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;Maybe Nils hasn&#8217;t got enough to keep a wife,&#8221; put in
			Clara ironically. &#8220;How about that, Nils?&#8221; she asked him
			frankly, as if she wanted to know.</p>

			<p><a class="pagenum" id="page112" title="112">&nbsp;</a>Nils looked at her coolly, raising one eyebrow. &#8220;Oh, I can
			keep her, all right.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;The way she wants to be kept?&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;With my wife, I&#8217;ll decide that,&#8221; replied Nils calmly. &#8220;I&#8217;ll
			give her what&#8217;s good for her.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Clara made a wry face. &#8220;You&#8217;ll give her the strap, I expect,
			like old Peter Oleson gave his wife.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;When she needs it,&#8221; said Nils lazily, locking his hands behind
			his head and squinting up through the leaves of the
			cherry tree. &#8220;Do you remember the time I squeezed the cherries
			all over your clean dress, and Aunt Johanna boxed my
			ears for me? My gracious, weren&#8217;t you mad! You had both
			hands full of cherries, and I squeezed &#8217;em and made the juice
			fly all over you. I liked to have fun with you; you&#8217;d get so mad.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;We <em>did</em> have fun, didn&#8217;t we? None of the other kids ever
			had so much fun. We knew how to play.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Nils dropped his elbows on the table and looked steadily
			across at her. &#8220;I&#8217;ve played with lots of girls since, but I haven&#8217;t
			found one who was such good fun.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Clara laughed. The late afternoon sun was shining full in
			her face, and deep in the back of her eyes there shone something
			fiery, like the yellow drops of Tokai in the brown glass
			bottle. &#8220;Can you still play, or are you only pretending?&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;I can play better than I used to, and harder.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you ever work, then?&#8221; She had not intended to say
			it. It slipped out because she was confused enough to say just
			the wrong thing.</p>

			<p>&#8220;I work between times.&#8221; Nils&#8217; steady gaze still beat upon
			her. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you worry about my working, Mrs. Ericson.
			You&#8217;re getting like all the rest of them.&#8221; He reached his
			brown, warm hand across the table and dropped it on Clara&#8217;s,
			which was cold as an icicle. &#8220;Last call for play, Mrs. Ericson!&#8221;
			Clara shivered, and suddenly her hands and cheeks grew
			warm. Her fingers lingered in his a moment, and they looked
			at each other earnestly. Joe Vavrika had put the mouth of the
			bottle to his lips and was swallowing the last drops of the
			Tokai, standing. The sun, just about to sink behind his shop,
			glistened on the bright glass, on his flushed face and curly
			yellow hair. &#8220;Look,&#8221; Clara whispered; &#8220;that&#8217;s the way I want
			to grow old.&#8221;</p>

			<h4><a class="pagenum" id="page113" title="113">&nbsp;</a>VI</h4>

			<p>On the day of Olaf Ericson&#8217;s barn-raising, his wife, for once
			in a way, rose early. Johanna Vavrika had been baking cakes
			and frying and boiling and spicing meats for a week beforehand,
			but it was not until the day before the party was to take
			place that Clara showed any interest in it. Then she was seized
			with one of her fitful spasms of energy, and took the wagon
			and little Eric and spent the day on Plum Creek, gathering
			vines and swamp goldenrod to decorate the barn.</p>

			<p>By four o&#8217;clock in the afternoon buggies and wagons began
			to arrive at the big unpainted building in front of Olaf&#8217;s
			house. When Nils and his mother came at five, there were
			more than fifty people in the barn, and a great drove of children.
			On the ground floor stood six long tables, set with the
			crockery of seven flourishing Ericson families, lent for the occasion.
			In the middle of each table was a big yellow pumpkin,
			hollowed out and filled with woodbine. In one corner of the
			barn, behind a pile of green-and-white-striped watermelons,
			was a circle of chairs for the old people; the younger guests
			sat on bushel measures or barbed-wire spools, and the children
			tumbled about in the haymow. The box-stalls Clara had
			converted into booths. The framework was hidden by goldenrod
			and sheaves of wheat, and the partitions were covered
			with wild grapevines full of fruit. At one of these Johanna
			Vavrika watched over her cooked meats, enough to provision
			an army; and at the next her kitchen girls had ranged the
			ice-cream freezers, and Clara was already cutting pies and
			cakes against the hour of serving. At the third stall, little
			Hilda, in a bright pink lawn dress, dispensed lemonade
			throughout the afternoon. Olaf, as a public man, had thought
			it inadvisable to serve beer in his barn; but Joe Vavrika had
			come over with two demijohns concealed in his buggy, and
			after his arrival the wagon-shed was much frequented by the
			men.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Hasn&#8217;t Cousin Clara fixed things lovely?&#8221; little Hilda whispered,
			when Nils went up to her stall and asked for lemonade.</p>

			<p>Nils leaned against the booth, talking to the excited little
			girl and watching the people. The barn faced the west, and
			<a class="pagenum" id="page114" title="114">&nbsp;</a>the sun, pouring in at the big doors, filled the whole interior
			with a golden light, through which filtered fine particles of
			dust from the haymow, where the children were romping.
			There was a great chattering from the stall where Johanna
			Vavrika exhibited to the admiring women her platters heaped
			with fried chicken, her roasts of beef, boiled tongues, and
			baked hams with cloves stuck in the crisp brown fat and garnished
			with tansy and parsley. The older women, having
			assured themselves that there were twenty kinds of cake,
			not counting cookies, and three dozen fat pies, repaired to the
			corner behind the pile of watermelons, put on their white
			aprons, and fell to their knitting and fancy-work. They were
			a fine company of old women, and a Dutch painter would
			have loved to find them there together, where the sun made
			bright patches on the floor and sent long, quivering shafts of
			gold through the dusky shade up among the rafters. There
			were fat, rosy old women who looked hot in their best black
			dresses; spare, alert old women with brown, dark-veined
			hands; and several of almost heroic frame, not less massive
			than old Mrs. Ericson herself. Few of them wore glasses,
			and old Mrs. Svendsen, a Danish woman, who was quite
			bald, wore the only cap among them. Mrs. Oleson, who had
			twelve big grandchildren, could still show two braids of yellow
			hair as thick as her own wrists. Among all these grandmothers
			there were more brown heads than white. They all
			had a pleased, prosperous air, as if they were more than satisfied
			with themselves and with life. Nils, leaning against
			Hilda&#8217;s lemonade-stand, watched them as they sat chattering
			in four languages, their fingers never lagging behind their
			tongues.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Look at them over there,&#8221; he whispered, detaining Clara
			as she passed him. &#8220;Aren&#8217;t they the Old Guard? I&#8217;ve just
			counted thirty hands. I guess they&#8217;ve wrung many a chicken&#8217;s
			neck and warmed many a boy&#8217;s jacket for him in their time.&#8221;</p>

			<p>In reality he fell into amazement when he thought of the
			Herculean labors those fifteen pairs of hands had performed:
			of the cows they had milked, the butter they had made, the
			gardens they had planted, the children and grandchildren they
			had tended, the brooms they had worn out, the mountains of
			food they had cooked. It made him dizzy. Clara Vavrika
			<a class="pagenum" id="page115" title="115">&nbsp;</a>smiled a hard, enigmatical smile at him and walked rapidly
			away. Nils&#8217; eyes followed her white figure as she went toward
			the house. He watched her walking alone in the sunlight,
			looked at her slender, defiant shoulders and her little hard-set
			head with its coils of blue-black hair. &#8220;No,&#8221; he reflected;
			&#8220;she&#8217;d never be like them, not if she lived here a hundred
			years. She&#8217;d only grow more bitter. You can&#8217;t tame a wild
			thing; you can only chain it. People aren&#8217;t all alike. I mustn&#8217;t
			lose my nerve.&#8221; He gave Hilda&#8217;s pigtail a parting tweak and
			set out after Clara. &#8220;Where to?&#8221; he asked, as he came upon
			her in the kitchen.</p>

			<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to the cellar for preserves.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;Let me go with you. I never get a moment alone with
			you. Why do you keep out of my way?&#8221;</p>

			<p>Clara laughed. &#8220;I don&#8217;t usually get in anybody&#8217;s way.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Nils followed her down the stairs and to the far corner of
			the cellar, where a basement window let in a stream of light.
			From a swinging shelf Clara selected several glass jars, each
			labeled in Johanna&#8217;s careful hand. Nils took up a brown flask.
			&#8220;What&#8217;s this? It looks good.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;It is. It&#8217;s some French brandy father gave me when I was
			married. Would you like some? Have you a corkscrew? I&#8217;ll get
			glasses.&#8221;</p>

			<p>When she brought them, Nils took them from her and put
			them down on the window-sill. &#8220;Clara Vavrika, do you remember
			how crazy I used to be about you?&#8221;</p>

			<p>Clara shrugged her shoulders. &#8220;Boys are always crazy about
			somebody or other. I dare say some silly has been crazy about
			Evelina Oleson. You got over it in a hurry.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;Because I didn&#8217;t come back, you mean? I had to get on,
			you know, and it was hard sledding at first. Then I heard
			you&#8217;d married Olaf.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;And then you stayed away from a broken heart,&#8221; Clara
			laughed.</p>

			<p>&#8220;And then I began to think about you more than I had
			since I first went away. I began to wonder if you were really
			as you had seemed to me when I was a boy. I thought I&#8217;d like
			to see. I&#8217;ve had lots of girls, but no one ever pulled me the
			same way. The more I thought about you, the more I remembered
			how it used to be&#8212;like hearing a wild tune you can&#8217;t
			<a class="pagenum" id="page116" title="116">&nbsp;</a>resist, calling you out at night. It had been a long while since
			anything had pulled me out of my boots, and I wondered
			whether anything ever could again.&#8221; Nils thrust his hands
			into his coat pockets and squared his shoulders, as his mother
			sometimes squared hers, as Olaf, in a clumsier manner,
			squared his. &#8220;So I thought I&#8217;d come back and see. Of course
			the family have tried to do me, and I rather thought I&#8217;d bring
			out father&#8217;s will and make a fuss. But they can have their old
			land; they&#8217;ve put enough sweat into it.&#8221; He took the flask and
			filled the two glasses carefully to the brim. &#8220;I&#8217;ve found out
			what I want from the Ericsons. Drink <em>skoal</em>, Clara.&#8221; He lifted
			his glass, and Clara took hers with downcast eyes. &#8220;Look at
			me, Clara Vavrika. <em>Skoal!</em>&#8221;</p>

			<p>She raised her burning eyes and answered fiercely: &#8220;<em>Skoal!</em>&#8221;</p>

			<hr class="thoughtbreak" />

			<p class="post_thoughtbreak">The barn supper began at six o&#8217;clock and lasted for two
			hilarious hours. Yense Nelson had made a wager that he could
			eat two whole fried chickens, and he did. Eli Swanson stowed
			away two whole custard pies, and Nick Hermanson ate a
			chocolate layer cake to the last crumb. There was even a
			cooky contest among the children, and one thin, slablike Bohemian
			boy consumed sixteen and won the prize, a ginger-bread
			pig which Johanna Vavrika had carefully decorated with
			red candies and burnt sugar. Fritz Sweiheart, the German carpenter,
			won in the pickle contest, but he disappeared soon
			after supper and was not seen for the rest of the evening. Joe
			Vavrika said that Fritz could have managed the pickles all
			right, but he had sampled the demijohn in his buggy too
			often before sitting down to the table.</p>

			<p>While the supper was being cleared away the two fiddlers
			began to tune up for the dance. Clara was to accompany them
			on her old upright piano, which had been brought down
			from her father&#8217;s. By this time Nils had renewed old acquaintances.
			Since his interview with Clara in the cellar, he had
			been busy telling all the old women how young they looked,
			and all the young ones how pretty they were, and assuring the
			men that they had here the best farm-land in the world. He
			had made himself so agreeable that old Mrs. Ericson&#8217;s friends
			began to come up to her and tell how lucky she was to get her
			smart son back again, and please to get him to play his flute.
			<a class="pagenum" id="page117" title="117">&nbsp;</a>Joe Vavrika, who could still play very well when he forgot that
			he had rheumatism, caught up a fiddle from Johnny Oleson
			and played a crazy Bohemian dance tune that set the wheels
			going. When he dropped the bow every one was ready to
			dance.</p>

			<p>Olaf, in a frock-coat and a solemn made-up necktie, led the
			grand march with his mother. Clara had kept well out of <em>that</em>
			by sticking to the piano. She played the march with a pompous
			solemnity which greatly amused the prodigal son, who
			went over and stood behind her.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Oh, aren&#8217;t you rubbing it into them, Clara Vavrika? And
			aren&#8217;t you lucky to have me here, or all your wit would be
			thrown away.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m used to being witty for myself. It saves my life.&#8221;</p>

			<p>The fiddles struck up a polka, and Nils convulsed Joe
			Vavrika by leading out Evelina Oleson, the homely school-teacher.
			His next partner was a very fat Swedish girl, who,
			although she was an heiress, had not been asked for the first
			dance, but had stood against the wall in her tight, high-heeled
			shoes, nervously fingering a lace handkerchief. She was soon
			out of breath, so Nils led her, pleased and panting, to her
			seat, and went over to the piano, from which Clara had been
			watching his gallantry. &#8220;Ask Olena Yenson,&#8221; she whispered.
			&#8220;She waltzes beautifully.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Olena, too, was rather inconveniently plump, handsome in
			a smooth, heavy way, with a fine color and good-natured,
			sleepy eyes. She was redolent of violet sachet powder, and
			had warm, soft, white hands, but she danced divinely, moving
			as smoothly as the tide coming in. &#8220;There, that&#8217;s something
			like,&#8221; Nils said as he released her. &#8220;You&#8217;ll give me the next
			waltz, won&#8217;t you? Now I must go and dance with my little
			cousin.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Hilda was greatly excited when Nils went up to her stall
			and held out his arm. Her little eyes sparkled, but she declared
			that she could not leave her lemonade. Old Mrs. Ericson,
			who happened along at this moment, said she would
			attend to that, and Hilda came out, as pink as her pink dress.
			The dance was a schottische, and in a moment her yellow
			braids were fairly standing on end. &#8220;Bravo!&#8221; Nils cried encouragingly.
			&#8220;Where did you learn to dance so nicely?&#8221;</p>

			<p><a class="pagenum" id="page118" title="118">&nbsp;</a>&#8220;My Cousin Clara taught me,&#8221; the little girl panted.</p>

			<p>Nils found Eric sitting with a group of boys who were too
			awkward or too shy to dance, and told him that he must
			dance the next waltz with Hilda.</p>

			<p>The boy screwed up his shoulders. &#8220;Aw, Nils, I can&#8217;t dance.
			My feet are too big; I look silly.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be thinking about yourself. It doesn&#8217;t matter how
			boys look.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Nils had never spoken to him so sharply before, and Eric
			made haste to scramble out of his corner and brush the straw
			from his coat.</p>

			<p>Clara nodded approvingly. &#8220;Good for you, Nils. I&#8217;ve been
			trying to get hold of him. They dance very nicely together; I
			sometimes play for them.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m obliged to you for teaching him. There&#8217;s no reason
			why he should grow up to be a lout.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;He&#8217;ll never be that. He&#8217;s more like you than any of them.
			Only he hasn&#8217;t your courage.&#8221; From her slanting eyes Clara
			shot forth one of those keen glances, admiring and at the
			same time challenging, which she seldom bestowed on any
			one, and which seemed to say, &#8220;Yes, I admire you, but I am
			your equal.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Clara was proving a much better host than Olaf, who, once
			the supper was over, seemed to feel no interest in anything
			but the lanterns. He had brought a locomotive headlight
			from town to light the revels, and he kept skulking about it as
			if he feared the mere light from it might set his new barn on
			fire. His wife, on the contrary, was cordial to every one, was
			animated and even gay. The deep salmon color in her cheeks
			burned vividly, and her eyes were full of life. She gave the
			piano over to the fat Swedish heiress, pulled her father away
			from the corner where he sat gossiping with his cronies, and
			made him dance a Bohemian dance with her. In his youth Joe
			had been a famous dancer, and his daughter got him so
			limbered up that every one sat round and applauded them.
			The old ladies were particularly delighted, and made them
			go through the dance again. From their corner where they
			watched and commented, the old women kept time with their
			feet and hands, and whenever the fiddles struck up a new air
			old Mrs. Svendsen&#8217;s white cap would begin to bob.</p>

			<p><a class="pagenum" id="page119" title="119">&nbsp;</a>Clara was waltzing with little Eric when Nils came up to
			them, brushed his brother aside, and swung her out among
			the dancers. &#8220;Remember how we used to waltz on rollers at
			the old skating-rink in town? I suppose people don&#8217;t do that
			any more. We used to keep it up for hours. You know, we
			never did moon around as other boys and girls did. It was
			dead serious with us from the beginning. When we were
			most in love with each other, we used to fight. You were
			always pinching people; your fingers were like little nippers.
			A regular snapping-turtle, you were. Lord, how you&#8217;d like
			Stockholm! Sit out in the streets in front of cafés and talk all
			night in summer. Just like a reception&#8212;officers and ladies
			and funny English people. Jolliest people in the world, the
			Swedes, once you get them going. Always drinking things&#8212;champagne
			and stout mixed, half-and-half; serve it out of big
			pitchers, and serve plenty. Slow pulse, you know; they can
			stand a lot. Once they light up, they&#8217;re glow-worms, I can tell
			you.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;All the same, you don&#8217;t really like gay people.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;<em>I</em> don&#8217;t?&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;No; I could see that when you were looking at the old
			women there this afternoon. They&#8217;re the kind you really admire,
			after all; women like your mother. And that&#8217;s the kind
			you&#8217;ll marry.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;Is it, Miss Wisdom? You&#8217;ll see who I&#8217;ll marry, and she
			won&#8217;t have a domestic virtue to bless herself with. She&#8217;ll be a
			snapping-turtle, and she&#8217;ll be a match for me. All the same,
			they&#8217;re a fine bunch of old dames over there. You admire
			them yourself.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;No, I don&#8217;t; I detest them.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;You won&#8217;t, when you look back on them from Stockholm
			or Budapest. Freedom settles all that. Oh, but you&#8217;re the real
			Bohemian Girl, Clara Vavrika!&#8221; Nils laughed down at her sullen
			frown and began mockingly to sing:</p>

			<blockquote class="poem">
				<p>&#8220;<em>Oh, how could a poor gypsy maiden like me</em></p>
				<p><em>Expect the proud bride of a baron to be?</em>&#8221;</p>
			</blockquote>

			<p>Clara clutched his shoulder. &#8220;Hush, Nils; every one is looking
			at you.&#8221;</p>

			<p><a class="pagenum" id="page120" title="120">&nbsp;</a>&#8220;I don&#8217;t care. They can&#8217;t gossip. It&#8217;s all in the family, as the
			Ericsons say when they divide up little Hilda&#8217;s patrimony
			amongst them. Besides, we&#8217;ll give them something to talk
			about when we hit the trail. Lord, it will be a godsend to
			them! They haven&#8217;t had anything so interesting to chatter
			about since the grasshopper year. It&#8217;ll give them a new lease
			of life. And Olaf won&#8217;t lose the Bohemian vote, either.
			They&#8217;ll have the laugh on him so that they&#8217;ll vote two apiece.
			They&#8217;ll send him to Congress. They&#8217;ll never forget his barn
			party, or us. They&#8217;ll always remember us as we&#8217;re dancing
			together now. We&#8217;re making a legend. Where&#8217;s my waltz,
			boys?&#8221; he called as they whirled past the fiddlers.</p>

			<p>The musicians grinned, looked at each other, hesitated, and
			began a new air; and Nils sang with them, as the couples fell
			from a quick waltz to a long, slow glide:</p>

			<blockquote class="poem">
				<p>&#8220;<em>When other lips and other hearts</em></p>
				<p class="i2"><em>Their tale of love shall tell,</em></p>
				<p><em>In language whose excess imparts</em></p>
				<p class="i2"><em>The power they feel so well,</em>&#8221;</p>
			</blockquote>

			<p>The old women applauded vigorously. &#8220;What a gay one he
			is, that Nils!&#8221; And old Mrs. Svendsen&#8217;s cap lurched dreamily
			from side to side to the flowing measure of the dance.</p>

			<blockquote class="poem">
				<p>&#8220;<em>Of days that have as ha-a-p-py been,</em></p>
				<p class="i2"><em>And you&#8217;ll remember me.</em>&#8221;</p>
			</blockquote>

			<h4>VII</h4>

			<p>The moonlight flooded that great, silent land. The reaped
			fields lay yellow in it. The straw stacks and poplar windbreaks
			threw sharp black shadows. The roads were white rivers of
			dust. The sky was a deep, crystalline blue, and the stars were
			few and faint. Everything seemed to have succumbed, to have
			sunk to sleep, under the great, golden, tender, midsummer
			moon. The splendor of it seemed to transcend human life and
			human fate. The senses were too feeble to take it in, and every
			time one looked up at the sky one felt unequal to it, as if one
			were sitting deaf under the waves of a great river of melody.
			<a class="pagenum" id="page121" title="121">&nbsp;</a>Near the road, Nils Ericson was lying against a straw stack in
			Olaf&#8217;s wheat-field. His own life seemed strange and unfamiliar
			to him, as if it were something he had read about, or
			dreamed, and forgotten. He lay very still, watching the white
			road that ran in front of him, lost itself among the fields, and
			then, at a distance, reappeared over a little hill. At last, against
			this white band he saw something moving rapidly, and he got
			up and walked to the edge of the field. &#8220;She is passing the
			row of poplars now,&#8221; he thought. He heard the padded beat
			of hoofs along the dusty road, and as she came into sight he
			stepped out and waved his arms. Then, for fear of frightening
			the horse, he drew back and waited. Clara had seen him, and
			she came up at a walk. Nils took the horse by the bit and
			stroked his neck.</p>

			<p>&#8220;What are you doing out so late, Clara Vavrika? I went
			to the house, but Johanna told me you had gone to your
			father&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;Who can stay in the house on a night like this? Aren&#8217;t you
			out yourself?&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;Ah, but that&#8217;s another matter.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Nils turned the horse into the field.</p>

			<p>&#8220;What are you doing? Where are you taking Norman?&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;Not far, but I want to talk to you to-night; I have something
			to say to you. I can&#8217;t talk to you at the house, with Olaf
			sitting there on the porch, weighing a thousand tons.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Clara laughed. &#8220;He won&#8217;t be sitting there now. He&#8217;s in bed
			by this time, and asleep&#8212;weighing a thousand tons.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Nils plodded on across the stubble. &#8220;Are you really going
			to spend the rest of your life like this, night after night, summer
			after summer? Haven&#8217;t you anything better to do on a
			night like this than to wear yourself and Norman out tearing
			across the country to your father&#8217;s and back? Besides, your
			father won&#8217;t live forever, you know. His little place will be
			shut up or sold, and then you&#8217;ll have nobody but the Ericsons.
			You&#8217;ll have to fasten down the hatches for the winter
			then.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Clara moved her head restlessly. &#8220;Don&#8217;t talk about that. I
			try never to think of it. If I lost father I&#8217;d lose everything,
			even my hold over the Ericsons.&#8221;</p>

			<p><a class="pagenum" id="page122" title="122">&nbsp;</a>&#8220;Bah! You&#8217;d lose a good deal more than that. You&#8217;d lose
			your race, everything that makes you yourself. You&#8217;ve lost a
			good deal of it now.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;Of what?&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;Of your love of life, your capacity for delight.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Clara put her hands up to her face. &#8220;I haven&#8217;t, Nils Ericson,
			I haven&#8217;t! Say anything to me but that. I won&#8217;t have it!&#8221; she
			declared vehemently.</p>

			<p>Nils led the horse up to a straw stack, and turned to Clara,
			looking at her intently, as he had looked at her that
			Sunday afternoon at Vavrika&#8217;s. &#8220;But why do you fight for that
			so? What good is the power to enjoy, if you never enjoy?
			Your hands are cold again; what are you afraid of all the time?
			Ah, you&#8217;re afraid of losing it; that&#8217;s what&#8217;s the matter with
			you! And you will, Clara Vavrika, you will! When I used to
			know you&#8212;listen; you&#8217;ve caught a wild bird in your hand,
			haven&#8217;t you, and felt its heart beat so hard that you were
			afraid it would shatter its little body to pieces? Well, you used
			to be just like that, a slender, eager thing with a wild delight
			inside you. That is how I remembered you. And I come back
			and find you&#8212;a bitter woman. This is a perfect ferret fight
			here; you live by biting and being bitten. Can&#8217;t you remember
			what life used to be? Can&#8217;t you remember that old delight?
			I&#8217;ve never forgotten it, or known its like, on land or
			sea.&#8221;</p>

			<p>He drew the horse under the shadow of the straw stack.
			Clara felt him take her foot out of the stirrup, and she slid
			softly down into his arms. He kissed her slowly. He was a
			deliberate man, but his nerves were steel when he wanted
			anything. Something flashed out from him like a knife out of
			a sheath. Clara felt everything slipping away from her; she
			was flooded by the summer night. He thrust his hand into his
			pocket, and then held it out at arm&#8217;s length. &#8220;Look,&#8221; he said.
			The shadow of the straw stack fell sharp across his wrist, and
			in the palm of his hand she saw a silver dollar shining.
			&#8220;That&#8217;s my pile,&#8221; he muttered; &#8220;will you go with me?&#8221;</p>

			<p>Clara nodded, and dropped her forehead on his shoulder.</p>

			<p>Nils took a deep breath. &#8220;Will you go with me to-night?&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;Where?&#8221; she whispered softly.</p>

			<p>&#8220;To town, to catch the midnight flyer.&#8221;</p>

			<p><a class="pagenum" id="page123" title="123">&nbsp;</a>Clara lifted her head and pulled herself together. &#8220;Are you
			crazy, Nils? We couldn&#8217;t go away like that.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the only way we ever will go. You can&#8217;t sit on the
			bank and think about it. You have to plunge. That&#8217;s the way
			I&#8217;ve always done, and it&#8217;s the right way for people like you
			and me. There&#8217;s nothing so dangerous as sitting still. You&#8217;ve
			only got one life, one youth, and you can let it slip through
			your fingers if you want to; nothing easier. Most people do
			that. You&#8217;d be better off tramping the roads with me than you
			are here.&#8221; Nils held back her head and looked into her eyes.
			&#8220;But I&#8217;m not that kind of a tramp, Clara. You won&#8217;t have to
			take in sewing. I&#8217;m with a Norwegian shipping line; came
			over on business with the New York offices, but now I&#8217;m going
			straight back to Bergen. I expect I&#8217;ve got as much money
			as the Ericsons. Father sent me a little to get started. They
			never knew about that. There, I hadn&#8217;t meant to tell you; I
			wanted you to come on your own nerve.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Clara looked off across the fields. &#8220;It isn&#8217;t that, Nils, but
			something seems to hold me. I&#8217;m afraid to pull against it. It
			comes out of the ground, I think.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;I know all about that. One has to tear loose. You&#8217;re not
			needed here. Your father will understand; he&#8217;s made like us.
			As for Olaf, Johanna will take better care of him than ever you
			could. It&#8217;s now or never, Clara Vavrika. My bag&#8217;s at the station;
			I smuggled it there yesterday.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Clara clung to him and hid her face against his shoulder.
			&#8220;Not to-night,&#8221; she whispered. &#8220;Sit here and talk to me to-night.
			I don&#8217;t want to go anywhere to-night. I may never love
			you like this again.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Nils laughed through his teeth. &#8220;You can&#8217;t come that on
			me. That&#8217;s not my way, Clara Vavrika. Eric&#8217;s mare is over
			there behind the stacks, and I&#8217;m off on the midnight. It&#8217;s
			good-by, or off across the world with me. My carriage won&#8217;t
			wait. I&#8217;ve written a letter to Olaf; I&#8217;ll mail it in town. When
			he reads it he won&#8217;t bother us&#8212;not if I know him. He&#8217;d
			rather have the land. Besides, I could demand an investigation
			of his administration of Cousin Henrik&#8217;s estate, and that
			would be bad for a public man. You&#8217;ve no clothes, I know;
			but you can sit up to-night, and we can get everything on the
			way. Where&#8217;s your old dash, Clara Vavrika? What&#8217;s become of
			<a class="pagenum" id="page124" title="124">&nbsp;</a>your Bohemian blood? I used to think you had courage
			enough for anything. Where&#8217;s your nerve&#8212;what are you
			waiting for?&#8221;</p>

			<p>Clara drew back her head, and he saw the slumberous fire
			in her eyes. &#8220;For you to say one thing, Nils Ericson.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;I never say that thing to any woman, Clara Vavrika.&#8221; He
			leaned back, lifted her gently from the ground, and whispered
			through his teeth: &#8220;But I&#8217;ll never, never let you go, not to any
			man on earth but me! Do you understand me? Now, wait
			here.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Clara sank down on a sheaf of wheat and covered her face
			with her hands. She did not know what she was going to
			do&#8212;whether she would go or stay. The great, silent country
			seemed to lay a spell upon her. The ground seemed to hold
			her as if by roots. Her knees were soft under her. She felt as if
			she could not bear separation from her old sorrows, from her
			old discontent. They were dear to her, they had kept her alive,
			they were a part of her. There would be nothing left of her if
			she were wrenched away from them. Never could she pass
			beyond that sky-line against which her restlessness had beat so
			many times. She felt as if her soul had built itself a nest there
			on that horizon at which she looked every morning and every
			evening, and it was dear to her, inexpressibly dear. She
			pressed her fingers against her eyeballs to shut it out. Beside
			her she heard the tramping of horses in the soft earth. Nils
			said nothing to her. He put his hands under her arms and
			lifted her lightly to her saddle. Then he swung himself into
			his own.</p>

			<p>&#8220;We shall have to ride fast to catch the midnight train. A
			last gallop, Clara Vavrika. Forward!&#8221;</p>

			<p>There was a start, a thud of hoofs along the moonlit road,
			two dark shadows going over the hill; and then the great, still
			land stretched untroubled under the azure night. Two shadows
			had passed.</p>

			<h4>VIII</h4>

			<p>A year after the flight of Olaf Ericson&#8217;s wife, the night train
			was steaming across the plains of Iowa. The conductor was
			hurrying through one of the day-coaches, his lantern on his
			<a class="pagenum" id="page125" title="125">&nbsp;</a>arm, when a lank, fair-haired boy sat up in one of the plush
			seats and tweaked him by the coat.</p>

			<p>&#8220;What is the next stop, please, sir?&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;Red Oak, Iowa. But you go through to Chicago, don&#8217;t
			you?&#8221; He looked down, and noticed that the boy&#8217;s eyes were
			red and his face was drawn, as if he were in trouble.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Yes. But I was wondering whether I could get off at the
			next place and get a train back to Omaha.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;Well, I suppose you could. Live in Omaha?&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;No. In the western part of the State. How soon do we get
			to Red Oak?&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;Forty minutes. You&#8217;d better make up your mind, so I can
			tell the baggageman to put your trunk off.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;Oh, never mind about that! I mean, I haven&#8217;t got any,&#8221;
			the boy added, blushing.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Run away,&#8221; the conductor thought, as he slammed the
			coach door behind him.</p>

			<p>Eric Ericson crumpled down in his seat and put his brown
			hand to his forehead. He had been crying, and he had had no
			supper, and his head was aching violently. &#8220;Oh, what shall I
			do?&#8221; he thought, as he looked dully down at his big shoes.
			&#8220;Nils will be ashamed of me; I haven&#8217;t got any spunk.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Ever since Nils had run away with his brother&#8217;s wife, life at
			home had been hard for little Eric. His mother and Olaf both
			suspected him of complicity. Mrs. Ericson was harsh and
			fault-finding, constantly wounding the boy&#8217;s pride; and Olaf
			was always getting her against him.</p>

			<p>Joe Vavrika heard often from his daughter. Clara had always
			been fond of her father, and happiness made her kinder. She
			wrote him long accounts of the voyage to Bergen, and of the
			trip she and Nils took through Bohemia to the little town
			where her father had grown up and where she herself was
			born. She visited all her kinsmen there, and sent her father
			news of his brother, who was a priest; of his sister, who had
			married a horse-breeder&#8212;of their big farm and their many
			children. These letters Joe always managed to read to little
			Eric. They contained messages for Eric and Hilda. Clara sent
			presents, too, which Eric never dared to take home and which
			poor little Hilda never even saw, though she loved to hear
			Eric tell about them when they were out getting the eggs
			<a class="pagenum" id="page126" title="126">&nbsp;</a>together. But Olaf once saw Eric coming out of Vavrika&#8217;s
			house,&#8212;the old man had never asked the boy to come into
			his saloon,&#8212;and Olaf went straight to his mother and told
			her. That night Mrs. Ericson came to Eric&#8217;s room after he was
			in bed and made a terrible scene. She could be very terrifying
			when she was really angry. She forbade him ever to speak to
			Vavrika again, and after that night she would not allow him
			to go to town alone. So it was a long while before Eric got
			any more news of his brother. But old Joe suspected what was
			going on, and he carried Clara&#8217;s letters about in his pocket.
			One Sunday he drove out to see a German friend of his, and
			chanced to catch sight of Eric, sitting by the cattle-pond in
			the big pasture. They went together into Fritz Oberlies&#8217; barn,
			and read the letters and talked things over. Eric admitted that
			things were getting hard for him at home. That very night old
			Joe sat down and laboriously penned a statement of the case
			to his daughter.</p>

			<p>Things got no better for Eric. His mother and Olaf felt
			that, however closely he was watched, he still, as they said,
			&#8220;heard.&#8221; Mrs. Ericson could not admit neutrality. She had
			sent Johanna Vavrika packing back to her brother&#8217;s, though
			Olaf would much rather have kept her than Anders&#8217; eldest
			daughter, whom Mrs. Ericson installed in her place. He was
			not so high-handed as his mother, and he once sulkily told
			her that she might better have taught her granddaughter to
			cook before she sent Johanna away. Olaf could have borne a
			good deal for the sake of prunes spiced in honey, the secret of
			which Johanna had taken away with her.</p>

			<p>At last two letters came to Joe Vavrika: one from Nils, inclosing
			a postal order for money to pay Eric&#8217;s passage to Bergen,
			and one from Clara, saying that Nils had a place for Eric
			in the offices of his company, that he was to live with them,
			and that they were only waiting for him to come. He was to
			leave New York on one of the boats of Nils&#8217; own line; the
			captain was one of their friends, and Eric was to make himself
			known at once.</p>

			<p>Nils&#8217; directions were so explicit that a baby could have followed
			them, Eric felt. And here he was, nearing Red Oak,
			Iowa, and rocking backward and forward in despair. Never
			had he loved his brother so much, and never had the big
			<a class="pagenum" id="page127" title="127">&nbsp;</a>world called to him so hard. But there was a lump in his
			throat which would not go down. Ever since nightfall he had
			been tormented by the thought of his mother, alone in that
			big house that had sent forth so many men. Her unkindness
			now seemed so little, and her loneliness so great. He remembered
			everything she had ever done for him: how frightened
			she had been when he tore his hand in the corn-sheller, and
			how she wouldn&#8217;t let Olaf scold him. When Nils went away
			he didn&#8217;t leave his mother all alone, or he would never have
			gone. Eric felt sure of that.</p>

			<p>The train whistled. The conductor came in, smiling not unkindly.
			&#8220;Well, young man, what are you going to do? We stop
			at Red Oak in three minutes.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;Yes, thank you. I&#8217;ll let you know.&#8221; The conductor went
			out, and the boy doubled up with misery. He couldn&#8217;t let his
			one chance go like this. He felt for his breast pocket and
			crackled Nils&#8217; kind letter to give him courage. He didn&#8217;t want
			Nils to be ashamed of him. The train stopped. Suddenly he
			remembered his brother&#8217;s kind, twinkling eyes, that always
			looked at you as if from far away. The lump in his throat
			softened. &#8220;Ah, but Nils, Nils would <em>understand</em>!&#8221; he thought.
			&#8220;That&#8217;s just it about Nils; he always understands.&#8221;</p>

			<p>A lank, pale boy with a canvas telescope stumbled off the
			train to the Red Oak siding, just as the conductor called, &#8220;All
			aboard!&#8221;</p>

			<hr class="thoughtbreak" />

			<p class="post_thoughtbreak">The next night Mrs. Ericson was sitting alone in her
			wooden rocking-chair on the front porch. Little Hilda had
			been sent to bed and had cried herself to sleep. The old woman&#8217;s
			knitting was in her lap, but her hands lay motionless on
			top of it. For more than an hour she had not moved a muscle.
			She simply sat, as only the Ericsons and the mountains can
			sit. The house was dark, and there was no sound but the
			croaking of the frogs down in the pond of the little pasture.</p>

			<p>Eric did not come home by the road, but across the fields,
			where no one could see him. He set his telescope down softly
			in the kitchen shed, and slipped noiselessly along the path to
			the front porch. He sat down on the step without saying anything.
			Mrs. Ericson made no sign, and the frogs croaked on.
			At last the boy spoke timidly.</p>

			<p><a class="pagenum" id="page128" title="128">&nbsp;</a>&#8220;I&#8217;ve come back, Mother.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;Very well,&#8221; said Mrs. Ericson.</p>

			<p>Eric leaned over and picked up a little stick out of the grass.</p>

			<p>&#8220;How about the milking?&#8221; he faltered.</p>

			<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s been done, hours ago.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;Who did you get?&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;Get? I did it myself. I can milk as good as any of you.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Eric slid along the step nearer to her. &#8220;Oh, Mother, why
			did you?&#8221; he asked sorrowfully. &#8220;Why didn&#8217;t you get one of
			Otto&#8217;s boys?&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t want anybody to know I was in need of a boy,&#8221;
			said Mrs. Ericson bitterly. She looked straight in front of her
			and her mouth tightened. &#8220;I always meant to give you the
			home farm,&#8221; she added.</p>

			<p>The boy started and slid closer. &#8220;Oh, Mother,&#8221; he faltered,
			&#8220;I don&#8217;t care about the farm. I came back because I thought
			you might be needing me, maybe.&#8221; He hung his head and got
			no further.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Very well,&#8221; said Mrs. Ericson. Her hand went out from
			her suddenly and rested on his head. Her fingers twined
			themselves in his soft, pale hair. His tears splashed down on
			the boards; happiness filled his heart.</p>

			<h3 class="story_title">Consequences <a class="return_toc" href="#contents" title="Return to Contents">ToC</a></h3>
			<p class="first_paragraph">Henry Eastman, a lawyer, aged forty, was standing beside
			the Flatiron building in a driving November rainstorm,
			signaling frantically for a taxi. It was six-thirty, and
			everything on wheels was engaged. The streets were in confusion
			about him, the sky was in turmoil above him, and the
			Flatiron building, which seemed about to blow down, threw
			water like a mill-shoot. Suddenly, out of the brutal struggle of
			men and cars and machines and people tilting at each other
			with umbrellas, a quiet, well-mannered limousine paused before
			him, at the curb, and an agreeable, ruddy countenance
			confronted him through the open window of the car.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you want me to pick you up, Mr. Eastman? I&#8217;m
			running directly home now.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Eastman recognized Kier Cavenaugh, a young man of pleasure,
			who lived in the house on Central Park South, where he
			himself had an apartment.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t I?&#8221; he exclaimed, bolting into the car. &#8220;I&#8217;ll risk getting
			your cushions wet without compunction. I came up in a
			taxi, but I didn&#8217;t hold it. Bad economy. I thought I saw your
			car down on Fourteenth Street about half an hour ago.&#8221;</p>

			<p>The owner of the car smiled. He had a pleasant, round face
			and round eyes, and a fringe of smooth, yellow hair showed
			under the rim of his soft felt hat. &#8220;With a lot of little broilers
			fluttering into it? You did. I know some girls who work in the
			cheap shops down there. I happened to be down-town and I
			stopped and took a load of them home. I do sometimes.
			Saves their poor little clothes, you know. Their shoes are
			never any good.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Eastman looked at his rescuer. &#8220;Aren&#8217;t they notoriously
			afraid of cars and smooth young men?&#8221; he inquired.</p>

			<p>Cavenaugh shook his head. &#8220;They know which cars are safe
			and which are chancy. They put each other wise. You have to
			take a bunch at a time, of course. The Italian girls can never
			come along; their men shoot. The girls understand, all right;
			but their fathers don&#8217;t. One gets to see queer places, sometimes,
			taking them home.&#8221;</p>

			<p><a class="pagenum" id="page130" title="130">&nbsp;</a>Eastman laughed drily. &#8220;Every time I touch the circle of
			your acquaintance, Cavenaugh, it&#8217;s a little wider. You must
			know New York pretty well by this time.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;Yes, but I&#8217;m on my good behavior below Twenty-third
			Street,&#8221; the young man replied with simplicity. &#8220;My little
			friends down there would give me a good character. They&#8217;re
			wise little girls. They have grand ways with each other, a romantic
			code of loyalty. You can find a good many of the lost
			virtues among them.&#8221;</p>

			<p>The car was standing still in a traffic block at Fortieth
			Street, when Cavenaugh suddenly drew his face away from
			the window and touched Eastman&#8217;s arm. &#8220;Look, please. You
			see that hansom with the bony gray horse&#8212;driver has a broken
			hat and red flannel around his throat. Can you see who is
			inside?&#8221;</p>

			<p>Eastman peered out. The hansom was just cutting across
			the line, and the driver was making a great fuss about it, bobbing
			his head and waving his whip. He jerked his dripping
			old horse into Fortieth Street and clattered off past the Public
			Library grounds toward Sixth Avenue. &#8220;No, I couldn&#8217;t see the
			passenger. Someone you know?&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;Could you see whether there was a passenger?&#8221; Cavenaugh
			asked.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Why, yes. A man, I think. I saw his elbow on the apron.
			No driver ever behaves like that unless he has a passenger.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;Yes, I may have been mistaken,&#8221; Cavenaugh murmured
			absent-mindedly. Ten minutes or so later, after Cavenaugh&#8217;s
			car had turned off Fifth Avenue into Fifty-eighth Street, Eastman
			exclaimed, &#8220;There&#8217;s your same cabby, and his cart&#8217;s
			empty. He&#8217;s headed for a drink now, I suppose.&#8221; The driver
			in the broken hat and the red flannel neck cloth was still brandishing
			the whip over his old gray. He was coming from the
			west now, and turned down Sixth Avenue, under the elevated.</p>

			<p>Cavenaugh&#8217;s car stopped at the bachelor apartment house
			between Sixth and Seventh Avenues where he and Eastman
			lived, and they went up in the elevator together. They were
			still talking when the lift stopped at Cavenaugh&#8217;s floor, and
			Eastman stepped out with him and walked down the hall,
			finishing his sentence while Cavenaugh found his latch-key.
			When he opened the door, a wave of fresh cigarette smoke
			<a class="pagenum" id="page131" title="131">&nbsp;</a>greeted them. Cavenaugh stopped short and stared into his
			hallway. &#8220;Now how in the devil&#8212;!&#8221; he exclaimed angrily.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Someone waiting for you? Oh, no, thanks. I wasn&#8217;t coming
			in. I have to work to-night. Thank you, but I couldn&#8217;t.&#8221;
			Eastman nodded and went up the two flights to his own
			rooms.</p>

			<p>Though Eastman did not customarily keep a servant he had
			this winter a man who had been lent to him by a friend who
			was abroad. Rollins met him at the door and took his coat
			and hat.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Put out my dinner clothes, Rollins, and then get out of
			here until ten o&#8217;clock. I&#8217;ve promised to go to a supper to-night.
			I shan&#8217;t be dining. I&#8217;ve had a late tea and I&#8217;m going to
			work until ten. You may put out some kumiss and biscuit for
			me.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Rollins took himself off, and Eastman settled down at the
			big table in his sitting-room. He had to read a lot of letters
			submitted as evidence in a breach of contract case, and before
			he got very far he found that long paragraphs in some of the
			letters were written in German. He had a German dictionary
			at his office, but none here. Rollins had gone, and anyhow,
			the bookstores would be closed. He remembered having seen
			a row of dictionaries on the lower shelf of one of Cavenaugh&#8217;s
			bookcases. Cavenaugh had a lot of books, though he never
			read anything but new stuff. Eastman prudently turned down
			his student&#8217;s lamp very low&#8212;the thing had an evil habit of
			smoking&#8212;and went down two flights to Cavenaugh&#8217;s door.</p>

			<p>The young man himself answered Eastman&#8217;s ring. He was
			freshly dressed for the evening, except for a brown smoking
			jacket, and his yellow hair had been brushed until it shone.
			He hesitated as he confronted his caller, still holding the door
			knob, and his round eyes and smooth forehead made their
			best imitation of a frown. When Eastman began to apologize,
			Cavenaugh&#8217;s manner suddenly changed. He caught his arm
			and jerked him into the narrow hall. &#8220;Come in, come in.
			Right along!&#8221; he said excitedly. &#8220;Right along,&#8221; he repeated as
			he pushed Eastman before him into his sitting-room. &#8220;Well
			I&#8217;ll&#8212;&#8221; he stopped short at the door and looked about his
			own room with an air of complete mystification. The back
			window was wide open and a strong wind was blowing in.
			<a class="pagenum" id="page132" title="132">&nbsp;</a>Cavenaugh walked over to the window and stuck out his
			head, looking up and down the fire escape. When he pulled
			his head in, he drew down the sash.</p>

			<p>&#8220;I had a visitor I wanted you to see,&#8221; he explained with a
			nervous smile. &#8220;At least I thought I had. He must have gone
			out that way,&#8221; nodding toward the window.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Call him back. I only came to borrow a German dictionary,
			if you have one. Can&#8217;t stay. Call him back.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Cavenaugh shook his head despondently. &#8220;No use. He&#8217;s
			beat it. Nowhere in sight.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;He must be active. Has he left something?&#8221; Eastman
			pointed to a very dirty white glove that lay on the floor under
			the window.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Yes, that&#8217;s his.&#8221; Cavenaugh reached for his tongs, picked
			up the glove, and tossed it into the grate, where it quickly
			shriveled on the coals. Eastman felt that he had happened in
			upon something disagreeable, possibly something shady, and
			he wanted to get away at once. Cavenaugh stood staring at
			the fire and seemed stupid and dazed; so he repeated his
			request rather sternly, &#8220;I think I&#8217;ve seen a German dictionary
			down there among your books. May I have it?&#8221;</p>

			<p>Cavenaugh blinked at him. &#8220;A German dictionary? Oh,
			possibly! Those were my father&#8217;s. I scarcely know what there
			is.&#8221; He put down the tongs and began to wipe his hands
			nervously with his handkerchief.</p>

			<p>Eastman went over to the bookcase behind the Chesterfield,
			opened the door, swooped upon the book he wanted
			and stuck it under his arm. He felt perfectly certain now that
			something shady had been going on in Cavenaugh&#8217;s rooms,
			and he saw no reason why he should come in for any hang-over.
			&#8220;Thanks. I&#8217;ll send it back to-morrow,&#8221; he said curtly as
			he made for the door.</p>

			<p>Cavenaugh followed him. &#8220;Wait a moment. I wanted you
			to see him. You did see his glove,&#8221; glancing at the grate.</p>

			<p>Eastman laughed disagreeably. &#8220;I saw a glove. That&#8217;s not
			evidence. Do your friends often use that means of exit? Somewhat
			inconvenient.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Cavenaugh gave him a startled glance. &#8220;Wouldn&#8217;t you think
			so? For an old man, a very rickety old party? The ladders are
			steep, you know, and rusty.&#8221; He approached the window
			<a class="pagenum" id="page133" title="133">&nbsp;</a>again and put it up softly. In a moment he drew his head back
			with a jerk. He caught Eastman&#8217;s arm and shoved him toward
			the window. &#8220;Hurry, please. Look! Down there.&#8221; He pointed
			to the little patch of paved court four flights down.</p>

			<p>The square of pavement was so small and the walls about it
			were so high, that it was a good deal like looking down a
			well. Four tall buildings backed upon the same court and
			made a kind of shaft, with flagstones at the bottom, and at
			the top a square of dark blue with some stars in it. At the
			bottom of the shaft Eastman saw a black figure, a man in a
			caped coat and a tall hat stealing cautiously around, not across
			the square of pavement, keeping close to the dark wall and
			avoiding the streak of light that fell on the flagstones from a
			window in the opposite house. Seen from that height he was
			of course fore-shortened and probably looked more shambling
			and decrepit than he was. He picked his way along with
			exaggerated care and looked like a silly old cat crossing a wet
			street. When he reached the gate that led into an alley way
			between two buildings, he felt about for the latch, opened the
			door a mere crack, and then shot out under the feeble lamp
			that burned in the brick arch over the gateway. The door
			closed after him.</p>

			<p>&#8220;He&#8217;ll get run in,&#8221; Eastman remarked curtly, turning away
			from the window. &#8220;That door shouldn&#8217;t be left unlocked.
			Any crook could come in. I&#8217;ll speak to the janitor about it, if
			you don&#8217;t mind,&#8221; he added sarcastically.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Wish you would.&#8221; Cavenaugh stood brushing down the
			front of his jacket, first with his right hand and then with his
			left. &#8220;You saw him, didn&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;Enough of him. Seems eccentric. I have to see a lot of
			buggy people. They don&#8217;t take me in any more. But I&#8217;m keeping
			you and I&#8217;m in a hurry myself. Good night.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Cavenaugh put out his hand detainingly and started to say
			something; but Eastman rudely turned his back and went
			down the hall and out of the door. He had never felt anything
			shady about Cavenaugh before, and he was sorry he had gone
			down for the dictionary. In five minutes he was deep in his
			papers; but in the half hour when he was loafing before he
			dressed to go out, the young man&#8217;s curious behavior came
			into his mind again.</p>

			<p><a class="pagenum" id="page134" title="134">&nbsp;</a>Eastman had merely a neighborly acquaintance with Cavenaugh.
			He had been to a supper at the young man&#8217;s rooms
			once, but he didn&#8217;t particularly like Cavenaugh&#8217;s friends; so
			the next time he was asked, he had another engagement. He
			liked Cavenaugh himself, if for nothing else than because he
			was so cheerful and trim and ruddy. A good complexion is
			always at a premium in New York, especially when it shines
			reassuringly on a man who does everything in the world to
			lose it. It encourages fellow mortals as to the inherent vigor
			of the human organism and the amount of bad treatment it
			will stand for. &#8220;Footprints that perhaps another,&#8221; etc.</p>

			<p>Cavenaugh, he knew, had plenty of money. He was the son
			of a Pennsylvania preacher, who died soon after he discovered
			that his ancestral acres were full of petroleum, and Kier had
			come to New York to burn some of the oil. He was thirty-two
			and was still at it; spent his life, literally, among the breakers.
			His motor hit the Park every morning as if it were the first
			time ever. He took people out to supper every night. He
			went from restaurant to restaurant, sometimes to half-a-dozen
			in an evening. The head waiters were his hosts and their cordiality
			made him happy. They made a life-line for him up
			Broadway and down Fifth Avenue. Cavenaugh was still fresh
			and smooth, round and plump, with a lustre to his hair and
			white teeth and a clear look in his round eyes. He seemed
			absolutely unwearied and unimpaired; never bored and never
			carried away.</p>

			<p>Eastman always smiled when he met Cavenaugh in the
			entrance hall, serenely going forth to or returning from gladiatorial
			combats with joy, or when he saw him rolling
			smoothly up to the door in his car in the morning after a
			restful night in one of the remarkable new roadhouses he was
			always finding. Eastman had seen a good many young men
			disappear on Cavenaugh&#8217;s route, and he admired this young
			man&#8217;s endurance.</p>

			<p>To-night, for the first time, he had got a whiff of something
			unwholesome about the fellow&#8212;bad nerves, bad company,
			something on hand that he was ashamed of, a visitor old and
			vicious, who must have had a key to Cavenaugh&#8217;s apartment,
			for he was evidently there when Cavenaugh returned at seven
			o&#8217;clock. Probably it was the same man Cavenaugh had seen in
			<a class="pagenum" id="page135" title="135">&nbsp;</a>the hansom. He must have been able to let himself in, for
			Cavenaugh kept no man but his chauffeur; or perhaps the
			janitor had been instructed to let him in. In either case, and
			whoever he was, it was clear enough that Cavenaugh was
			ashamed of him and was mixing up in questionable business
			of some kind.</p>

			<p>Eastman sent Cavenaugh&#8217;s book back by Rollins, and for
			the next few weeks he had no word with him beyond a casual
			greeting when they happened to meet in the hall or the elevator.
			One Sunday morning Cavenaugh telephoned up to him
			to ask if he could motor out to a roadhouse in Connecticut
			that afternoon and have supper; but when Eastman found
			there were to be other guests he declined.</p>

			<hr class="thoughtbreak" />

			<p class="post_thoughtbreak">On New Year&#8217;s eve Eastman dined at the University Club
			at six o&#8217;clock and hurried home before the usual manifestations
			of insanity had begun in the streets. When Rollins
			brought his smoking coat, he asked him whether he wouldn&#8217;t
			like to get off early.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Yes, sir. But won&#8217;t you be dressing, Mr. Eastman?&#8221; he inquired.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Not to-night.&#8221; Eastman handed him a bill. &#8220;Bring some
			change in the morning. There&#8217;ll be fees.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Rollins lost no time in putting everything to rights for the
			night, and Eastman couldn&#8217;t help wishing that he were in
			such a hurry to be off somewhere himself. When he heard the
			hall door close softly, he wondered if there were any place,
			after all, that he wanted to go. From his window he looked
			down at the long lines of motors and taxis waiting for a signal
			to cross Broadway. He thought of some of their probable
			destinations and decided that none of those places pulled him
			very hard. The night was warm and wet, the air was drizzly.
			Vapor hung in clouds about the <cite>Times</cite> Building, half hid the
			top of it, and made a luminous haze along Broadway. While
			he was looking down at the army of wet, black carriage-tops
			and their reflected headlights and tail-lights, Eastman heard a
			ring at his door. He deliberated. If it were a caller, the hall
			porter would have telephoned up. It must be the janitor.
			When he opened the door, there stood a rosy young man in a
			tuxedo, without a coat or hat.</p>

			<p><a class="pagenum" id="page136" title="136">&nbsp;</a>&#8220;Pardon. Should I have telephoned? I half thought you
			wouldn&#8217;t be in.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Eastman laughed. &#8220;Come in, Cavenaugh. You weren&#8217;t sure
			whether you wanted company or not, eh, and you were trying
			to let chance decide it? That was exactly my state of mind.
			Let&#8217;s accept the verdict.&#8221; When they emerged from the narrow
			hall into his sitting-room, he pointed out a seat by the
			fire to his guest. He brought a tray of decanters and soda
			bottles and placed it on his writing table.</p>

			<p>Cavenaugh hesitated, standing by the fire. &#8220;Sure you
			weren&#8217;t starting for somewhere?&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;Do I look it? No, I was just making up my mind to stick it
			out alone when you rang. Have one?&#8221; he picked up a tall
			tumbler.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Yes, thank you. I always do.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Eastman chuckled. &#8220;Lucky boy! So will I. I had a very early
			dinner. New York is the most arid place on holidays,&#8221; he continued
			as he rattled the ice in the glasses. &#8220;When one gets too
			old to hit the rapids down there, and tired of gobbling food
			to heathenish dance music, there is absolutely no place where
			you can get a chop and some milk toast in peace, unless you
			have strong ties of blood brotherhood on upper Fifth Avenue.
			But you, why aren&#8217;t you starting for somewhere?&#8221;</p>

			<p>The young man sipped his soda and shook his head as he
			replied:</p>

			<p>&#8220;Oh, I couldn&#8217;t get a chop, either. I know only flashy people,
			of course.&#8221; He looked up at his host with such a grave
			and candid expression that Eastman decided there couldn&#8217;t be
			anything very crooked about the fellow. His smooth cheeks
			were positively cherubic.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Well, what&#8217;s the matter with them? Aren&#8217;t they flashing
			to-night?&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;Only the very new ones seem to flash on New Year&#8217;s eve.
			The older ones fade away. Maybe they are hunting a chop,
			too.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;Well&#8221;&#8212;Eastman sat down&#8212;&#8220;holidays do dash one. I was
			just about to write a letter to a pair of maiden aunts in my old
			home town, up-state; old coasting hill, snow-covered pines,
			lights in the church windows. That&#8217;s what you&#8217;ve saved me
			from.&#8221;</p>

			<p><a class="pagenum" id="page137" title="137">&nbsp;</a>Cavenaugh shook himself. &#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m sure that wouldn&#8217;t
			have been good for you. Pardon me,&#8221; he rose and took a
			photograph from the bookcase, a handsome man in shooting
			clothes. &#8220;Dudley, isn&#8217;t it? Did you know him well?&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;Yes. An old friend. Terrible thing, wasn&#8217;t it? I haven&#8217;t got
			over the jolt yet.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;His suicide? Yes, terrible! Did you know his wife?&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;Slightly. Well enough to admire her very much. She must
			be terribly broken up. I wonder Dudley didn&#8217;t think of that.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Cavenaugh replaced the photograph carefully, lit a cigarette,
			and standing before the fire began to smoke. &#8220;Would
			you mind telling me about him? I never met him, but of
			course I&#8217;d read a lot about him, and I can&#8217;t help feeling interested.
			It was a queer thing.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Eastman took out his cigar case and leaned back in his deep
			chair. &#8220;In the days when I knew him best he hadn&#8217;t any story,
			like the happy nations. Everything was properly arranged for
			him before he was born. He came into the world happy,
			healthy, clever, straight, with the right sort of connections
			and the right kind of fortune, neither too large nor too small.
			He helped to make the world an agreeable place to live in
			until he was twenty-six. Then he married as he should have
			married. His wife was a Californian, educated abroad. Beautiful.
			You have seen her picture?&#8221;</p>

			<p>Cavenaugh nodded. &#8220;Oh, many of them.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;She was interesting, too. Though she was distinctly a person
			of the world, she had retained something, just enough of
			the large Western manner. She had the habit of authority, of
			calling out a special train if she needed it, of using all our
			ingenious mechanical contrivances lightly and easily, without
			over-rating them. She and Dudley knew how to live better
			than most people. Their house was the most charming one I
			have ever known in New York. You felt freedom there, and a
			zest of life, and safety&#8212;absolute sanctuary&#8212;from everything
			sordid or petty. A whole society like that would justify the
			creation of man and would make our planet shine with a soft,
			peculiar radiance among the constellations. You think I&#8217;m
			putting it on thick?&#8221;</p>

			<p>The young man sighed gently. &#8220;Oh, no! One has always
			felt there must be people like that. I&#8217;ve never known any.&#8221;</p>

			<p><a class="pagenum" id="page138" title="138">&nbsp;</a>&#8220;They had two children, beautiful ones. After they had
			been married for eight years, Rosina met this Spaniard. He
			must have amounted to something. She wasn&#8217;t a flighty
			woman. She came home and told Dudley how matters stood.
			He persuaded her to stay at home for six months and try to
			pull up. They were both fair-minded people, and I&#8217;m as sure
			as if I were the Almighty, that she did try. But at the end of
			the time, Rosina went quietly off to Spain, and Dudley went
			to hunt in the Canadian Rockies. I met his party out there. I
			didn&#8217;t know his wife had left him and talked about her a good
			deal. I noticed that he never drank anything, and his light
			used to shine through the log chinks of his room until all
			hours, even after a hard day&#8217;s hunting. When I got back to
			New York, rumors were creeping about. Dudley did not come
			back. He bought a ranch in Wyoming, built a big log house
			and kept splendid dogs and horses. One of his sisters went
			out to keep house for him, and the children were there when
			they were not in school. He had a great many visitors, and
			everyone who came back talked about how well Dudley kept
			things going.</p>

			<p>&#8220;He put in two years out there. Then, last month, he had
			to come back on business. A trust fund had to be settled up,
			and he was administrator. I saw him at the club; same light,
			quick step, same gracious handshake. He was getting gray,
			and there was something softer in his manner; but he had a
			fine red tan on his face and said he found it delightful to be
			here in the season when everything is going hard. The Madison
			Avenue house had been closed since Rosina left it. He
			went there to get some things his sister wanted. That, of
			course, was the mistake. He went alone, in the afternoon, and
			didn&#8217;t go out for dinner&#8212;found some sherry and tins of biscuit
			in the sideboard. He shot himself sometime that night.
			There were pistols in his smoking-room. They found burnt
			out candles beside him in the morning. The gas and electricity
			were shut off. I suppose there, in his own house, among his
			own things, it was too much for him. He left no letters.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Cavenaugh blinked and brushed the lapel of his coat. &#8220;I
			suppose,&#8221; he said slowly, &#8220;that every suicide is logical and
			reasonable, if one knew all the facts.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Eastman roused himself. &#8220;No, I don&#8217;t think so. I&#8217;ve known
			<a class="pagenum" id="page139" title="139">&nbsp;</a>too many fellows who went off like that&#8212;more than I deserve,
			I think&#8212;and some of them were absolutely inexplicable.
			I can understand Dudley; but I can&#8217;t see why healthy
			bachelors, with money enough, like ourselves, need such a
			device. It reminds me of what Dr. Johnson said, that the most
			discouraging thing about life is the number of fads and hobbies
			and fake religions it takes to put people through a few
			years of it.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;Dr. Johnson? The specialist? Oh, the old fellow!&#8221; said
			Cavenaugh imperturbably. &#8220;Yes, that&#8217;s interesting. Still, I
			fancy if one knew the facts&#8212;Did you know about Wyatt?&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think so.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;You wouldn&#8217;t, probably. He was just a fellow about town
			who spent money. He wasn&#8217;t one of the <em lang="it" xml:lang="it">forestieri</em>, though.
			Had connections here and owned a fine old place over on
			Staten Island. He went in for botany, and had been all over,
			hunting things; rusts, I believe. He had a yacht and used to
			take a gay crowd down about the South Seas, botanizing. He
			really did botanize, I believe. I never knew such a spender&#8212;only
			not flashy. He helped a lot of fellows and he was awfully
			good to girls, the kind who come down here to get a little
			fun, who don&#8217;t like to work and still aren&#8217;t really tough, the
			kind you see talking hard for their dinner. Nobody knows
			what becomes of them, or what they get out of it, and there
			are hundreds of new ones every year. He helped dozens of
			&#8217;em; it was he who got me curious about the little shop girls.
			Well, one afternoon when his tea was brought, he took prussic
			acid instead. He didn&#8217;t leave any letters, either; people of
			any taste don&#8217;t. They wouldn&#8217;t leave any material reminder if
			they could help it. His lawyers found that he had just $314.72
			above his debts when he died. He had planned to spend all
			his money, and then take his tea; he had worked it out carefully.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Eastman reached for his pipe and pushed his chair away
			from the fire. &#8220;That looks like a considered case, but I don&#8217;t
			think philosophical suicides like that are common. I think
			they usually come from stress of feeling and are really, as the
			newspapers call them, desperate acts; done without a motive.
			You remember when Anna Karenina was under the wheels,
			she kept saying, &#8216;Why am I here?&#8217;&#8221;</p>

			<p><a class="pagenum" id="page140" title="140">&nbsp;</a>Cavenaugh rubbed his upper lip with his pink finger and
			made an effort to wrinkle his brows. &#8220;May I, please?&#8221; reaching
			for the whiskey. &#8220;But have you,&#8221; he asked, blinking as the
			soda flew at him, &#8220;have you ever known, yourself, cases that
			were really inexplicable?&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;A few too many. I was in Washington just before Captain
			Jack Purden was married and I saw a good deal of him. Popular
			army man, fine record in the Philippines, married a
			charming girl with lots of money; mutual devotion. It was the
			gayest wedding of the winter, and they started for Japan.
			They stopped in San Francisco for a week and missed their
			boat because, as the bride wrote back to Washington, they
			were too happy to move. They took the next boat, were both
			good sailors, had exceptional weather. After they had been
			out for two weeks, Jack got up from his deck chair one afternoon,
			yawned, put down his book, and stood before his wife.
			&#8216;Stop reading for a moment and look at me.&#8217; She laughed and
			asked him why. &#8216;Because you happen to be good to look at.&#8217;
			He nodded to her, went back to the stern and was never seen
			again. Must have gone down to the lower deck and slipped
			overboard, behind the machinery. It was the luncheon hour,
			not many people about; steamer cutting through a soft green
			sea. That&#8217;s one of the most baffling cases I know. His friends
			raked up his past, and it was as trim as a cottage garden. If
			he&#8217;d so much as dropped an ink spot on his fatigue uniform,
			they&#8217;d have found it. He wasn&#8217;t emotional or moody; wasn&#8217;t,
			indeed, very interesting; simply a good soldier, fond of all the
			pompous little formalities that make up a military man&#8217;s life.
			What do you make of that, my boy?&#8221;</p>

			<p>Cavenaugh stroked his chin. &#8220;It&#8217;s very puzzling, I admit.
			Still, if one knew everything&#8212;&#8212;&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;But we do know everything. His friends wanted to find
			something to help them out, to help the girl out, to help the
			case of the human creature.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t mean things that people could unearth,&#8221; said
			Cavenaugh uneasily. &#8220;But possibly there were things that
			couldn&#8217;t be found out.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Eastman shrugged his shoulders. &#8220;It&#8217;s my experience that
			when there are &#8216;things&#8217; as you call them, they&#8217;re very apt to be
			<a class="pagenum" id="page141" title="141">&nbsp;</a>found. There is no such thing as a secret. To make any move
			at all one has to employ human agencies, employ at least one
			human agent. Even when the pirates killed the men who buried
			their gold for them, the bones told the story.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Cavenaugh rubbed his hands together and smiled his sunny
			smile.</p>

			<p>&#8220;I like that idea. It&#8217;s reassuring. If we can have no secrets, it
			means that we can&#8217;t, after all, go so far afield as we might,&#8221; he
			hesitated, &#8220;yes, as we might.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Eastman looked at him sourly. &#8220;Cavenaugh, when you&#8217;ve
			practised law in New York for twelve years, you find that people
			can&#8217;t go far in any direction, except&#8212;&#8221; He thrust his forefinger
			sharply at the floor. &#8220;Even in that direction, few people
			can do anything out of the ordinary. Our range is limited.
			Skip a few baths, and we become personally objectionable.
			The slightest carelessness can rot a man&#8217;s integrity or give him
			ptomaine poisoning. We keep up only by incessant cleansing
			operations, of mind and body. What we call character, is held
			together by all sorts of tacks and strings and glue.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Cavenaugh looked startled. &#8220;Come now, it&#8217;s not so bad
			as that, is it? I&#8217;ve always thought that a serious man, like
			you, must know a lot of Launcelots.&#8221; When Eastman only
			laughed, the younger man squirmed about in his chair. He
			spoke again hastily, as if he were embarrassed. &#8220;Your military
			friend may have had personal experiences, however, that his
			friends couldn&#8217;t possibly get a line on. He may accidentally
			have come to a place where he saw himself in too unpleasant
			a light. I believe people can be chilled by a draft from outside,
			somewhere.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;Outside?&#8221; Eastman echoed. &#8220;Ah, you mean the far outside!
			Ghosts, delusions, eh?&#8221;</p>

			<p>Cavenaugh winced. &#8220;That&#8217;s putting it strong. Why not say
			tips from the outside? Delusions belong to a diseased mind,
			don&#8217;t they? There are some of us who have no minds to speak
			of, who yet have had experiences. I&#8217;ve had a little something
			in that line myself and I don&#8217;t look it, do I?&#8221;</p>

			<p>Eastman looked at the bland countenance turned toward
			him. &#8220;Not exactly. What&#8217;s your delusion?&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not a delusion. It&#8217;s a haunt.&#8221;</p>

			<p><a class="pagenum" id="page142" title="142">&nbsp;</a>The lawyer chuckled. &#8220;Soul of a lost Casino girl?&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;No; an old gentleman. A most unattractive old gentleman,
			who follows me about.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;Does he want money?&#8221;</p>

			<p>Cavenaugh sat up straight. &#8220;No. I wish to God he wanted
			anything&#8212;but the pleasure of my society! I&#8217;d let him clean
			me out to be rid of him. He&#8217;s a real article. You saw him
			yourself that night when you came to my rooms to borrow a
			dictionary, and he went down the fire-escape. You saw him
			down in the court.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;Well, I saw somebody down in the court, but I&#8217;m too
			cautious to take it for granted that I saw what you saw.
			Why, anyhow, should I see your haunt? If it was your friend
			I saw, he impressed me disagreeably. How did you pick
			him up?&#8221;</p>

			<p>Cavenaugh looked gloomy. &#8220;That was queer, too. Charley
			Burke and I had motored out to Long Beach, about a year
			ago, sometime in October, I think. We had supper and stayed
			until late. When we were coming home, my car broke
			down. We had a lot of girls along who had to get back for
			morning rehearsals and things; so I sent them all into town in
			Charley&#8217;s car, and he was to send a man back to tow me
			home. I was driving myself, and didn&#8217;t want to leave my machine.
			We had not taken a direct road back; so I was stuck in a
			lonesome, woody place, no houses about. I got chilly and
			made a fire, and was putting in the time comfortably enough,
			when this old party steps up. He was in shabby evening
			clothes and a top hat, and had on his usual white gloves.
			How he got there, at three o&#8217;clock in the morning, miles from
			any town or railway, I&#8217;ll leave it to you to figure out. <em>He</em>
			surely had no car. When I saw him coming up to the fire, I
			disliked him. He had a silly, apologetic walk. His teeth were
			chattering, and I asked him to sit down. He got down like a
			clothes-horse folding up. I offered him a cigarette, and when
			he took off his gloves I couldn&#8217;t help noticing how knotted
			and spotty his hands were. He was asthmatic, and took his
			breath with a wheeze. &#8216;Haven&#8217;t you got anything&#8212;refreshing
			in there?&#8217; he asked, nodding at the car. When I told him I
			hadn&#8217;t, he sighed. &#8216;Ah, you young fellows are greedy. You
			<a class="pagenum" id="page143" title="143">&nbsp;</a>drink it all up. You drink it all up, all up&#8212;up!&#8217; he kept chewing
			it over.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Cavenaugh paused and looked embarrassed again. &#8220;The
			thing that was most unpleasant is difficult to explain. The old
			man sat there by the fire and leered at me with a silly sort of
			admiration that was&#8212;well, more than humiliating. &#8216;Gay boy,
			gay dog!&#8217; he would mutter, and when he grinned he showed
			his teeth, worn and yellow&#8212;shells. I remembered that it was
			better to talk casually to insane people; so I remarked carelessly
			that I had been out with a party and got stuck.</p>

			<p>&#8220;&#8216;Oh yes, I remember,&#8217; he said, &#8216;Flora and Lottie and Maybelle
			and Marcelline, and poor Kate.&#8217;</p>

			<p>&#8220;He had named them correctly; so I began to think I had
			been hitting the bright waters too hard.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Things I drank never had seemed to make me woody; but
			you can never tell when trouble is going to hit you. I pulled
			my hat down and tried to look as uncommunicative as possible;
			but he kept croaking on from time to time, like this:
			&#8216;Poor Kate! Splendid arms, but dope got her. She took up
			with Eastern religions after she had her hair dyed. Got to
			going to a Swami&#8217;s joint, and smoking opium. Temple of the
			Lotus, it was called, and the police raided it.&#8217;</p>

			<p>&#8220;This was nonsense, of course; the young woman was in
			the pink of condition. I let him rave, but I decided that if
			something didn&#8217;t come out for me pretty soon, I&#8217;d foot it
			across Long Island. There wasn&#8217;t room enough for the two of
			us. I got up and took another try at my car. He hopped right
			after me.</p>

			<p>&#8220;&#8216;Good car,&#8217; he wheezed, &#8216;better than the little Ford.&#8217;</p>

			<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d had a Ford before, but so has everybody; that was a
			safe guess.</p>

			<p>&#8220;&#8216;Still,&#8217; he went on, &#8216;that run in from Huntington Bay in
			the rain wasn&#8217;t bad. Arrested for speeding, he-he.&#8217;</p>

			<p>&#8220;It was true I had made such a run, under rather unusual
			circumstances, and had been arrested. When at last I heard
			my life-boat snorting up the road, my visitor got up, sighed,
			and stepped back into the shadow of the trees. I didn&#8217;t wait to
			see what became of him, you may believe. That was visitation
			number one. What do you think of it?&#8221;</p>

			<p><a class="pagenum" id="page144" title="144">&nbsp;</a>Cavenaugh looked at his host defiantly. Eastman smiled.</p>

			<p>&#8220;I think you&#8217;d better change your mode of life, Cavenaugh.
			Had many returns?&#8221; he inquired.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Too many, by far.&#8221; The young man took a turn about the
			room and came back to the fire. Standing by the mantel he lit
			another cigarette before going on with his story:</p>

			<p>&#8220;The second visitation happened in the street, early in the
			evening, about eight o&#8217;clock. I was held up in a traffic block
			before the Plaza. My chauffeur was driving. Old Nibbs steps
			up out of the crowd, opens the door of my car, gets in and
			sits down beside me. He had on wilted evening clothes, same
			as before, and there was some sort of heavy scent about him.
			Such an unpleasant old party! A thorough-going rotter; you
			knew it at once. This time he wasn&#8217;t talkative, as he had been
			when I first saw him. He leaned back in the car as if he owned
			it, crossed his hands on his stick and looked out at the
			crowd&#8212;sort of hungrily.</p>

			<p>&#8220;I own I really felt a loathing compassion for him. We got
			down the avenue slowly. I kept looking out at the mounted
			police. But what could I do? Have him pulled? I was afraid
			to. I was awfully afraid of getting him into the papers.</p>

			<p>&#8220;&#8216;I&#8217;m going to the New Astor,&#8217; I said at last. &#8216;Can I take
			you anywhere?&#8217;</p>

			<p>&#8220;&#8216;No, thank you,&#8217; says he. &#8216;I get out when you do. I&#8217;m due
			on West 44th. I&#8217;m dining to-night with Marcelline&#8212;all that
			is left of her!&#8217;</p>

			<p>&#8220;He put his hand to his hat brim with a grewsome salute.
			Such a scandalous, foolish old face as he had! When we pulled
			up at the Astor, I stuck my hand in my pocket and asked him
			if he&#8217;d like a little loan.</p>

			<p>&#8220;&#8216;No, thank you, but&#8217;&#8212;he leaned over and whispered,
			ugh!&#8212;&#8216;but save a little, save a little. Forty years from now&#8212;a
			little&#8212;comes in handy. Save a little.&#8217;</p>

			<p>&#8220;His eyes fairly glittered as he made his remark. I jumped
			out. I&#8217;d have jumped into the North River. When he tripped
			off, I asked my chauffeur if he&#8217;d noticed the man who got
			into the car with me. He said he knew someone was with me,
			but he hadn&#8217;t noticed just when he got in. Want to hear any
			more?&#8221;</p>

			<p>Cavenaugh dropped into his chair again. His plump cheeks
			<a class="pagenum" id="page145" title="145">&nbsp;</a>were a trifle more flushed than usual, but he was perfectly
			calm. Eastman felt that the young man believed what he was
			telling him.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Of course I do. It&#8217;s very interesting. I don&#8217;t see quite
			where you are coming out though.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Cavenaugh sniffed. &#8220;No more do I. I really feel that I&#8217;ve
			been put upon. I haven&#8217;t deserved it any more than any other
			fellow of my kind. Doesn&#8217;t it impress you disagreeably?&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;Well, rather so. Has anyone else seen your friend?&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;You saw him.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;We won&#8217;t count that. As I said, there&#8217;s no certainty that
			you and I saw the same person in the court that night. Has
			anyone else had a look in?&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;People sense him rather than see him. He usually crops up
			when I&#8217;m alone or in a crowd on the street. He never approaches
			me when I&#8217;m with people I know, though I&#8217;ve seen
			him hanging about the doors of theatres when I come out
			with a party; loafing around the stage exit, under a wall; or
			across the street, in a doorway. To be frank, I&#8217;m not anxious
			to introduce him. The third time, it was I who came upon
			him. In November my driver, Harry, had a sudden attack of
			appendicitis. I took him to the Presbyterian Hospital in the
			car, early in the evening. When I came home, I found the old
			villain in my rooms. I offered him a drink, and he sat down.
			It was the first time I had seen him in a steady light, with his
			hat off.</p>

			<p>&#8220;His face is lined like a railway map, and as to color&#8212;Lord,
			what a liver! His scalp grows tight to his skull, and his
			hair is dyed until it&#8217;s perfectly dead, like a piece of black
			cloth.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Cavenaugh ran his fingers through his own neatly trimmed
			thatch, and seemed to forget where he was for a moment.</p>

			<p>&#8220;I had a twin brother, Brian, who died when we were
			sixteen. I have a photograph of him on my wall, an enlargement
			from a kodak of him, doing a high jump, rather good
			thing, full of action. It seemed to annoy the old gentleman.
			He kept looking at it and lifting his eyebrows, and finally he
			got up, tip-toed across the room, and turned the picture to
			the wall.</p>

			<p>&#8220;&#8216;Poor Brian! Fine fellow, but died young,&#8217; says he.</p>

			<p><a class="pagenum" id="page146" title="146">&nbsp;</a>&#8220;Next morning, there was the picture, still reversed.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;Did he stay long?&#8221; Eastman asked interestedly.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Half an hour, by the clock.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;Did he talk?&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;Well, he rambled.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;What about?&#8221;</p>

			<p>Cavenaugh rubbed his pale eyebrows before answering.</p>

			<p>&#8220;About things that an old man ought to want to forget.
			His conversation is highly objectionable. Of course he knows
			me like a book; everything I&#8217;ve ever done or thought. But
			when he recalls them, he throws a bad light on them, somehow.
			Things that weren&#8217;t much off color, look rotten. He
			doesn&#8217;t leave one a shred of self-respect, he really doesn&#8217;t.
			That&#8217;s the amount of it.&#8221; The young man whipped out his
			handkerchief and wiped his face.</p>

			<p>&#8220;You mean he really talks about things that none of your
			friends know?&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;Oh, dear, yes! Recalls things that happened in school.
			Anything disagreeable. Funny thing, he always turns Brian&#8217;s
			picture to the wall.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;Does he come often?&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;Yes, oftener, now. Of course I don&#8217;t know how he gets in
			down-stairs. The hall boys never see him. But he has a key to
			my door. I don&#8217;t know how he got it, but I can hear him turn
			it in the lock.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;Why don&#8217;t you keep your driver with you, or telephone
			for me to come down?&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;He&#8217;d only grin and go down the fire escape as he did
			before. He&#8217;s often done it when Harry&#8217;s come in suddenly.
			Everybody has to be alone sometimes, you know. Besides, I
			don&#8217;t want anybody to see him. He has me there.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;But why not? Why do you feel responsible for him?&#8221;</p>

			<p>Cavenaugh smiled wearily. &#8220;That&#8217;s rather the point, isn&#8217;t
			it? Why do I? But I absolutely do. That identifies him, more
			than his knowing all about my life and my affairs.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Eastman looked at Cavenaugh thoughtfully. &#8220;Well, I
			should advise you to go in for something altogether different
			and new, and go in for it hard; business, engineering, metallurgy,
			something this old fellow wouldn&#8217;t be interested in.
			See if you can make him remember logarithms.&#8221;</p>

			<p><a class="pagenum" id="page147" title="147">&nbsp;</a>Cavenaugh sighed. &#8220;No, he has me there, too. People never
			really change; they go on being themselves. But I would
			never make much trouble. Why can&#8217;t they let me alone, damn
			it! I&#8217;d never hurt anybody, except, perhaps&#8212;&#8212;&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;Except your old gentleman, eh?&#8221; Eastman laughed. &#8220;Seriously,
			Cavenaugh, if you want to shake him, I think a year on
			a ranch would do it. He would never be coaxed far from his
			favorite haunts. He would dread Montana.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Cavenaugh pursed up his lips. &#8220;So do I!&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;Oh, you think you do. Try it, and you&#8217;ll find out. A gun and
			a horse beats all this sort of thing. Besides losing your haunt,
			you&#8217;d be putting ten years in the bank for yourself. I know a
			good ranch where they take people, if you want to try it.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;Thank you. I&#8217;ll consider. Do you think I&#8217;m batty?&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;No, but I think you&#8217;ve been doing one sort of thing too
			long. You need big horizons. Get out of this.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Cavenaugh smiled meekly. He rose lazily and yawned behind
			his hand. &#8220;It&#8217;s late, and I&#8217;ve taken your whole evening.&#8221;
			He strolled over to the window and looked out. &#8220;Queer
			place, New York; rough on the little fellows. Don&#8217;t you feel
			sorry for them, the girls especially? I do. What a fight they
			put up for a little fun! Why, even that old goat is sorry for
			them, the only decent thing he kept.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Eastman followed him to the door and stood in the hall,
			while Cavenaugh waited for the elevator. When the car came
			up Cavenaugh extended his pink, warm hand. &#8220;Good night.&#8221;</p>

			<p>The cage sank and his rosy countenance disappeared, his
			round-eyed smile being the last thing to go.</p>

			<hr class="thoughtbreak" />

			<p class="post_thoughtbreak">Weeks passed before Eastman saw Cavenaugh again. One
			morning, just as he was starting for Washington to argue a
			case before the Supreme Court, Cavenaugh telephoned him at
			his office to ask him about the Montana ranch he had recommended;
			said he meant to take his advice and go out there for
			the spring and summer.</p>

			<p>When Eastman got back from Washington, he saw dusty
			trunks, just up from the trunk room, before Cavenaugh&#8217;s
			door. Next morning, when he stopped to see what the young
			man was about, he found Cavenaugh in his shirt sleeves,
			packing.</p>

			<p><a class="pagenum" id="page148" title="148">&nbsp;</a>&#8220;I&#8217;m really going; off to-morrow night. You didn&#8217;t think it
			of me, did you?&#8221; he asked gaily.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;ve always had hopes of you!&#8221; Eastman declared.
			&#8220;But you are in a hurry, it seems to me.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;Yes, I am in a hurry.&#8221; Cavenaugh shot a pair of leggings
			into one of the open trunks. &#8220;I telegraphed your ranch people,
			used your name, and they said it would be all right. By
			the way, some of my crowd are giving a little dinner for me at
			Rector&#8217;s to-night. Couldn&#8217;t you be persuaded, as it&#8217;s a farewell
			occasion?&#8221; Cavenaugh looked at him hopefully.</p>

			<p>Eastman laughed and shook his head. &#8220;Sorry, Cavenaugh,
			but that&#8217;s too gay a world for me. I&#8217;ve got too much work
			lined up before me. I wish I had time to stop and look at your
			guns, though. You seem to know something about guns.
			You&#8217;ve more than you&#8217;ll need, but nobody can have too many
			good ones.&#8221; He put down one of the revolvers regretfully.
			&#8220;I&#8217;ll drop in to see you in the morning, if you&#8217;re up.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;I shall be up, all right. I&#8217;ve warned my crowd that I&#8217;ll cut
			away before midnight.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;You won&#8217;t, though,&#8221; Eastman called back over his shoulder
			as he hurried down-stairs.</p>

			<p>The next morning, while Eastman was dressing, Rollins
			came in greatly excited.</p>

			<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m a little late, sir. I was stopped by Harry, Mr. Cavenaugh&#8217;s
			driver. Mr. Cavenaugh shot himself last night, sir.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Eastman dropped his vest and sat down on his shoe-box.
			&#8220;You&#8217;re drunk, Rollins,&#8221; he shouted. &#8220;He&#8217;s going away to-day!&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;Yes, sir. Harry found him this morning. Ah, he&#8217;s quite
			dead, sir. Harry&#8217;s telephoned for the coroner. Harry don&#8217;t
			know what to do with the ticket.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Eastman pulled on his coat and ran down the stairway.
			Cavenaugh&#8217;s trunks were strapped and piled before the door.
			Harry was walking up and down the hall with a long green
			railroad ticket in his hand and a look of complete stupidity on
			his face.</p>

			<p>&#8220;What shall I do about this ticket, Mr. Eastman?&#8221; he whispered.
			&#8220;And what about his trunks? He had me tell the transfer
			people to come early. They may be here any minute. Yes,
			<a class="pagenum" id="page149" title="149">&nbsp;</a>sir. I brought him home in the car last night, before twelve, as
			cheerful as could be.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;Be quiet, Harry. Where is he?&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;In his bed, sir.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Eastman went into Cavenaugh&#8217;s sleeping-room. When he
			came back to the sitting-room, he looked over the writing
			table; railway folders, time-tables, receipted bills, nothing
			else. He looked up for the photograph of Cavenaugh&#8217;s twin
			brother. There it was, turned to the wall. Eastman took it
			down and looked at it; a boy in track clothes, half lying in the
			air, going over the string shoulders first, above the heads of a
			crowd of lads who were running and cheering. The face was
			somewhat blurred by the motion and the bright sunlight.
			Eastman put the picture back, as he found it. Had Cavenaugh
			entertained his visitor last night, and had the old man been
			more convincing than usual? &#8220;Well, at any rate, he&#8217;s seen to it
			that the old man can&#8217;t establish identity. What a soft lot they
			are, fellows like poor Cavenaugh!&#8221; Eastman thought of his
			office as a delightful place.</p>

			<h3>The Bookkeeper&#8217;s Wife <a class="return_toc" href="#contents" title="Return to Contents">ToC</a></h3>
			<p class="first_paragraph">Nobody but the janitor was stirring about the offices of
			the Remsen Paper Company, and still Percy Bixby sat at
			his desk, crouched on his high stool and staring out at the
			tops of the tall buildings flushed with the winter sunset, at the
			hundreds of windows, so many rectangles of white electric
			light, flashing against the broad waves of violet that ebbed
			across the sky. His ledgers were all in their places, his desk
			was in order, his office coat on its peg, and yet Percy&#8217;s
			smooth, thin face wore the look of anxiety and strain which
			usually meant that he was behind in his work. He was trying
			to persuade himself to accept a loan from the company without
			the company&#8217;s knowledge. As a matter of fact, he had
			already accepted it. His books were fixed, the money, in
			a black-leather bill-book, was already inside his waistcoat
			pocket.</p>

			<p>He had still time to change his mind, to rectify the false
			figures in his ledger, and to tell Stella Brown that they
			couldn&#8217;t possibly get married next month. There he always
			halted in his reasoning, and went back to the beginning.</p>

			<p>The Remsen Paper Company was a very wealthy concern,
			with easy, old-fashioned working methods. They did a longtime
			credit business with safe customers, who never thought
			of paying up very close on their large indebtedness. From the
			payments on these large accounts Percy had taken a hundred
			dollars here and two hundred there until he had made up the
			thousand he needed. So long as he stayed by the books himself
			and attended to the mail-orders he couldn&#8217;t possibly be
			found out. He could move these little shortages about from
			account to account indefinitely. He could have all the time he
			needed to pay back the deficit, and more time than he needed.</p>

			<p>Although he was so far along in one course of action, his
			mind still clung resolutely to the other. He did not believe he
			was going to do it. He was the least of a sharper in the world.
			Being scrupulously honest even in the most trifling matters
			was a pleasure to him. He was the sort of young man that
			Socialists hate more than they hate capitalists. He loved his
			<a class="pagenum" id="page151" title="151">&nbsp;</a>desk, he loved his books, which had no handwriting in them
			but his own. He never thought of resenting the fact that he
			had written away in those books the good red years between
			twenty-one and twenty-seven. He would have hated to let any
			one else put so much as a pen-scratch in them. He liked all
			the boys about the office; his desk, worn smooth by the
			sleeves of his alpaca coat; his rulers and inks and pens and
			calendars. He had a great pride in working economics, and he
			always got so far ahead when supplies were distributed that
			he had drawers full of pencils and pens and rubber bands
			against a rainy day.</p>

			<p>Percy liked regularity: to get his work done on time, to
			have his half-day off every Saturday, to go to the theater Saturday
			night, to buy a new necktie twice a month, to appear in
			a new straw hat on the right day in May, and to know what
			was going on in New York. He read the morning and evening
			papers coming and going on the elevated, and preferred journals
			of approximate reliability. He got excited about ballgames
			and elections and business failures, was not above an
			interest in murders and divorce scandals, and he checked the
			news off as neatly as he checked his mail-orders. In short,
			Percy Bixby was like the model pupil who is satisfied with his
			lessons and his teachers and his holidays, and who would
			gladly go to school all his life. He had never wanted anything
			outside his routine until he wanted Stella Brown to marry
			him, and that had upset everything.</p>

			<p>It wasn&#8217;t, he told himself for the hundredth time, that she
			was extravagant. Not a bit of it. She was like all girls. Moreover,
			she made good money, and why should she marry unless
			she could better herself? The trouble was that he had lied
			to her about his salary. There were a lot of fellows rushing
			Mrs. Brown&#8217;s five daughters, and they all seemed to have fixed
			on Stella as first choice and this or that one of the sisters as
			second. Mrs. Brown thought it proper to drop an occasional
			hint in the presence of these young men to the effect that she
			expected Stella to &#8220;do well.&#8221; It went without saying that hair
			and complexion like Stella&#8217;s could scarcely be expected to
			do poorly. Most of the boys who went to the house and took
			the girls out in a bunch to dances and movies seemed to realize
			this. They merely wanted a whirl with Stella before they
			<a class="pagenum" id="page152" title="152">&nbsp;</a>settled down to one of her sisters. It was tacitly understood
			that she came too high for them. Percy had sensed all this
			through those slumbering instincts which awake in us all to
			befriend us in love or in danger.</p>

			<p>But there was one of his rivals, he knew, who was a man to
			be reckoned with. Charley Greengay was a young salesman
			who wore tailor-made clothes and spotted waistcoats, and
			had a necktie for every day in the month. His air was that of a
			young man who is out for things that come high and who is
			going to get them. Mrs. Brown was ever and again dropping
			a word before Percy about how the girl that took Charley
			would have her flat furnished by the best furniture people,
			and her china-closet stocked with the best ware, and would
			have nothing to worry about but nicks and scratches. It was
			because he felt himself pitted against this pulling power of
			Greengay&#8217;s that Percy had brazenly lied to Mrs. Brown, and
			told her that his salary had been raised to fifty a week, and
			that now he wanted to get married.</p>

			<p>When he threw out this challenge to Mother Brown, Percy
			was getting thirty-five dollars a week, and he knew well
			enough that there were several hundred thousand young men
			in New York who would do his work as well as he did for
			thirty.</p>

			<p>These were the factors in Percy&#8217;s present situation. He
			went over them again and again as he sat stooping on his tall
			stool. He had quite lost track of time when he heard the janitor
			call good night to the watchman. Without thinking what
			he was doing, he slid into his overcoat, caught his hat, and
			rushed out to the elevator, which was waiting for the janitor.
			The moment the car dropped, it occurred to him that the
			thing was decided without his having made up his mind at all.
			The familiar floors passed him, ten, nine, eight, seven. By the
			time he reached the fifth, there was no possibility of going
			back; the click of the drop-lever seemed to settle that. The
			money was in his pocket. Now, he told himself as he hurried
			out into the exciting clamor of the street, he was not going to
			worry about it any more.</p>

			<hr class="thoughtbreak" />

			<p class="post_thoughtbreak">When Percy reached the Browns&#8217; flat on 123d Street that
			evening he felt just the slightest chill in Stella&#8217;s greeting. He
			<a class="pagenum" id="page153" title="153">&nbsp;</a>could make that all right, he told himself, as he kissed her
			lightly in the dark three-by-four entrance-hall. Percy&#8217;s courting
			had been prosecuted mainly in the Bronx or in winged
			pursuit of a Broadway car. When he entered the crowded
			sitting-room he greeted Mrs. Brown respectfully and the four
			girls playfully. They were all piled on one couch, reading the
			continued story in the evening paper, and they didn&#8217;t think it
			necessary to assume more formal attitudes for Percy. They
			looked up over the smeary pink sheets of paper, and handed
			him, as Percy said, the same old jolly:</p>

			<p>&#8220;Hullo, Perc&#8217;! Come to see me, ain&#8217;t you? So flattered!&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;Any sweet goods on you, Perc&#8217;? Anything doing in the
			bong-bong line to-night?&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;Look at his new neckwear! Say, Perc&#8217;, remember me. That
			tie would go lovely with my new tailored waist.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;Quit your kiddin&#8217;, girls!&#8221; called Mrs. Brown, who was
			drying shirt-waists on the dining-room radiator. &#8220;And, Percy,
			mind the rugs when you&#8217;re steppin&#8217; round among them gum-drops.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Percy fired his last shot at the recumbent figures, and
			followed Stella into the dining-room, where the table and
			two large easy-chairs formed, in Mrs. Brown&#8217;s estimation, a
			proper background for a serious suitor.</p>

			<p>&#8220;I say, Stell&#8217;,&#8221; he began as he walked about the table with
			his hands in his pockets, &#8220;seems to me we ought to begin
			buying our stuff.&#8221; She brightened perceptibly. &#8220;Ah,&#8221; Percy
			thought, &#8220;so that <em>was</em> the trouble!&#8221; &#8220;To-morrow&#8217;s Saturday;
			why can&#8217;t we make an afternoon of it?&#8221; he went on cheerfully.
			&#8220;Shop till we&#8217;re tired, then go to Houtin&#8217;s for dinner, and
			end up at the theater.&#8221;</p>

			<p>As they bent over the lists she had made of things needed,
			Percy glanced at her face. She was very much out of her sisters&#8217;
			class and out of his, and he kept congratulating himself
			on his nerve. He was going in for something much too handsome
			and expensive and distinguished for him, he felt, and it
			took courage to be a plunger. To begin with, Stella was the
			sort of girl who had to be well dressed. She had pale primrose
			hair, with bluish tones in it, very soft and fine, so that it lay
			smooth however she dressed it, and pale-blue eyes, with
			blond eyebrows and long, dark lashes. She would have been a
			<a class="pagenum" id="page154" title="154">&nbsp;</a>little too remote and languid even for the fastidious Percy had
			it not been for her hard, practical mouth, with lips that always
			kept their pink even when the rest of her face was pale. Her
			employers, who at first might be struck by her indifference,
			understood that anybody with that sort of mouth would get
			through the work.</p>

			<p>After the shopping-lists had been gone over, Percy took up
			the question of the honeymoon. Stella said she had been
			thinking of Atlantic City. Percy met her with firmness. Whatever
			happened, he couldn&#8217;t leave his books now.</p>

			<p>&#8220;I want to do my traveling right here on Forty-second
			Street, with a high-price show every night,&#8221; he declared. He
			made out an itinerary, punctuated by theaters and restaurants,
			which Stella consented to accept as a substitute for Atlantic
			City.</p>

			<p>&#8220;They give your fellows a week off when they&#8217;re married,
			don&#8217;t they?&#8221; she asked.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Yes, but I&#8217;ll want to drop into the office every morning to
			look after my mail. That&#8217;s only businesslike.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d like to have you treated as well as the others, though.&#8221;
			Stella turned the rings about on her pale hand and looked at
			her polished finger-tips.</p>

			<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll look out for that. What do you say to a little walk,
			Stell&#8217;?&#8221; Percy put the question coaxingly. When Stella was
			pleased with him she went to walk with him, since that was
			the only way in which Percy could ever see her alone. When
			she was displeased, she said she was too tired to go out. To-night
			she smiled at him incredulously, and went to put on her
			hat and gray fur piece.</p>

			<p>Once they were outside, Percy turned into a shadowy side
			street that was only partly built up, a dreary waste of derricks
			and foundation holes, but comparatively solitary. Stella liked
			Percy&#8217;s steady, sympathetic silences; she was not a chatterbox
			herself. She often wondered why she was going to marry
			Bixby instead of Charley Greengay. She knew that Charley
			would go further in the world. Indeed, she had often coolly
			told herself that Percy would never go very far. But, as she
			admitted with a shrug, she was &#8220;weak to Percy.&#8221; In the capable
			New York stenographer, who estimated values coldly and
			got the most for the least outlay, there was something left
			<a class="pagenum" id="page155" title="155">&nbsp;</a>that belonged to another kind of woman&#8212;something that
			liked the very things in Percy that were not good business
			assets. However much she dwelt upon the effectiveness of
			Greengay&#8217;s dash and color and assurance, her mind always
			came back to Percy&#8217;s neat little head, his clean-cut face, and
			warm, clear, gray eyes, and she liked them better than Charley&#8217;s
			fullness and blurred floridness. Having reckoned up their
			respective chances with no doubtful result, she opposed a
			mild obstinacy to her own good sense. &#8220;I guess I&#8217;ll take
			Percy, <em>anyway</em>,&#8221; she said simply, and that was all the good her
			clever business brain did her.</p>

			<p class="post_thoughtbreak">Percy spent a night of torment, lying tense on his bed in the
			dark, and figuring out how long it would take him to pay
			back the money he was advancing to himself. Any fool could
			do it in five years, he reasoned, but he was going to do it in
			three. The trouble was that his expensive courtship had taken
			every penny of his salary. With competitors like Charley
			Greengay, you had to spend money or drop out. Certain
			birds, he reflected ruefully, are supplied with more attractive
			plumage when they are courting, but nature hadn&#8217;t been so
			thoughtful for men. When Percy reached the office in the
			morning he climbed on his tall stool and leaned his arms on
			his ledger. He was so glad to feel it there that he was faint
			and weak-kneed.</p>

			<hr class="thoughtbreak" />

			<p class="post_thoughtbreak">Oliver Remsen, Junior, had brought new blood into the
			Remsen Paper Company. He married shortly after Percy
			Bixby did, and in the five succeeding years he had considerably
			enlarged the company&#8217;s business and profits. He had
			been particularly successful in encouraging efficiency and loyalty
			in the employees. From the time he came into the office
			he had stood for shorter hours, longer holidays, and a generous
			consideration of men&#8217;s necessities. He came out of college
			on the wave of economic reform, and he continued to read
			and think a good deal about how the machinery of labor is
			operated. He knew more about the men who worked for him
			than their mere office records.</p>

			<p>Young Remsen was troubled about Percy Bixby because he
			took no summer vacations&#8212;always asked for the two weeks&#8217;
			<a class="pagenum" id="page156" title="156">&nbsp;</a>extra pay instead. Other men in the office had skipped a vacation
			now and then, but Percy had stuck to his desk for five
			years, had tottered to his stool through attacks of grippe and
			tonsilitis. He seemed to have grown fast to his ledger, and it
			was to this that Oliver objected. He liked his men to stay
			men, to look like men and live like men. He remembered how
			alert and wide-awake Bixby had seemed to him when he himself
			first came into the office. He had picked Bixby out as the
			most intelligent and interested of his father&#8217;s employees, and
			since then had often wondered why he never seemed to see
			chances to forge ahead. Promotions, of course, went to the
			men who went after them. When Percy&#8217;s baby died, he went
			to the funeral, and asked Percy to call on him if he needed
			money. Once when he chanced to sit down by Bixby on the
			elevated and found him reading Bryce&#8217;s &#8220;American Commonwealth,&#8221;
			he asked him to make use of his own large office
			library. Percy thanked him, but he never came for any books.
			Oliver wondered whether his bookkeeper really tried to avoid
			him.</p>

			<p>One evening Oliver met the Bixbys in the lobby of a theater.
			He introduced Mrs. Remsen to them, and held them for
			some moments in conversation. When they got into their motor,
			Mrs. Remsen said:</p>

			<p>&#8220;Is that little man afraid of you, Oliver? He looked like a
			scared rabbit.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Oliver snapped the door, and said with a shade of irritation:</p>

			<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s the matter with him. He&#8217;s the fellow
			I&#8217;ve told you about who never takes a vacation. I half believe
			it&#8217;s his wife. She looks pitiless enough for anything.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s very pretty of her kind,&#8221; mused Mrs. Remsen, &#8220;but
			rather chilling. One can see that she has ideas about elegance.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;Rather unfortunate ones for a bookkeeper&#8217;s wife. I surmise
			that Percy felt she was overdressed, and that made him
			awkward with me. I&#8217;ve always suspected that fellow of good
			taste.&#8221;</p>

			<p>After that, when Remsen passed the counting-room and
			saw Percy screwed up over his ledger, he often remembered
			Mrs. Bixby, with her cold, pale eyes and long lashes, and her
			<a class="pagenum" id="page157" title="157">&nbsp;</a>expression that was something between indifference and discontent.
			She rose behind Percy&#8217;s bent shoulders like an apparition.</p>

			<p>One spring afternoon Remsen was closeted in his private
			office with his lawyer until a late hour. As he came down the
			long hall in the dusk he glanced through the glass partition
			into the counting-room, and saw Percy Bixby huddled up on
			his tall stool, though it was too dark to work. Indeed, Bixby&#8217;s
			ledger was closed, and he sat with his two arms resting on the
			brown cover. He did not move a muscle when young Remsen
			entered.</p>

			<p>&#8220;You are late, Bixby, and so am I,&#8221; Oliver began genially as
			he crossed to the front of the room and looked out at the
			lighted windows of other tall buildings. &#8220;The fact is, I&#8217;ve
			been doing something that men have a foolish way of putting
			off. I&#8217;ve been making my will.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;Yes, sir.&#8221; Percy brought it out with a deep breath.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Glad to be through with it,&#8221; Oliver went on. &#8220;Mr. Melton
			will bring the paper back to-morrow, and I&#8217;d like to ask you
			to be one of the witnesses.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d be very proud, Mr. Remsen.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;Thank you, Bixby. Good night.&#8221; Remsen took up his hat
			just as Percy slid down from his stool.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Mr. Remsen, I&#8217;m told you&#8217;re going to have the books
			gone over.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;Why, yes, Bixby. Don&#8217;t let that trouble you. I&#8217;m taking in
			a new partner, you know, an old college friend. Just because
			he is a friend, I insist upon all the usual formalities. But it is a
			formality, and I&#8217;ll guarantee the expert won&#8217;t make a scratch
			on your books. Good night. You&#8217;d better be coming, too.&#8221;
			Remsen had reached the door when he heard &#8220;Mr. Remsen!&#8221;
			in a desperate voice behind him. He turned, and saw Bixby
			standing uncertainly at one end of the desk, his hand still on
			his ledger, his uneven shoulders drooping forward and his
			head hanging as if he were seasick. Remsen came back and
			stood at the other end of the long desk. It was too dark to see
			Bixby&#8217;s face clearly.</p>

			<p>&#8220;What is it, Bixby?&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;Mr. Remsen, five years ago, just before I was married, I
			falsified the books a thousand dollars, and I used the money.&#8221;
			<a class="pagenum" id="page158" title="158">&nbsp;</a>Percy leaned forward against his desk, which took him just
			across the chest.</p>

			<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that, Bixby?&#8221; Young Remsen spoke in a tone of
			polite surprise. He felt painfully embarrassed.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Yes, sir. I thought I&#8217;d get it all paid back before this. I&#8217;ve
			put back three hundred, but the books are still seven hundred
			out of true. I&#8217;ve played the shortages about from account to
			account these five years, but an expert would find &#8217;em in
			twenty-four hours.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t just understand how&#8212;&#8221; Oliver stopped and shook
			his head.</p>

			<p>&#8220;I held it out of the Western remittances, Mr. Remsen.
			They were coming in heavy just then. I was up against it. I
			hadn&#8217;t saved anything to marry on, and my wife thought I
			was getting more money than I was. Since we&#8217;ve been married,
			I&#8217;ve never had the nerve to tell her. I could have paid it
			all back if it hadn&#8217;t been for the unforeseen expenses.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Remsen sighed.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Being married is largely unforeseen expenses, Percy.
			There&#8217;s only one way to fix this up: I&#8217;ll give you seven hundred
			dollars in cash to-morrow, and you can give me your
			personal note, with the understanding that I hold ten dollars
			a week out of your pay-check until it is paid. I think you
			ought to tell your wife exactly how you are fixed, though. You
			can&#8217;t expect her to help you much when she doesn&#8217;t know.&#8221;</p>

			<hr class="thoughtbreak" />

			<p class="post_thoughtbreak">That night Mrs. Bixby was sitting in their flat, waiting for
			her husband. She was dressed for a bridge party, and often
			looked with impatience from her paper to the Mission clock,
			as big as a coffin and with nothing but two weights dangling
			in its hollow framework. Percy had been loath to buy the
			clock when they got their furniture, and he had hated it ever
			since. Stella had changed very little since she came into the
			flat a bride. Then she wore her hair in a Floradora pompadour;
			now she wore it hooded close about her head like a
			scarf, in a rather smeary manner, like an Impressionist&#8217;s
			brush-work. She heard her husband come in and close the
			door softly. While he was taking off his hat in the narrow
			tunnel of a hall, she called to him:</p>

			<p>&#8220;I hope you&#8217;ve had something to eat down-town. You&#8217;ll
			<a class="pagenum" id="page159" title="159">&nbsp;</a>have to dress right away.&#8221; Percy came in and sat down. She
			looked up from the evening paper she was reading. &#8220;You&#8217;ve
			no time to sit down. We must start in fifteen minutes.&#8221;</p>

			<p>He shaded his eyes from the glaring overhead light.</p>

			<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid I can&#8217;t go anywhere to-night. I&#8217;m all in.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Mrs. Bixby rattled her paper, and turned from the theatrical
			page to the fashions.</p>

			<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll feel better after you dress. We won&#8217;t stay late.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Her even persistence usually conquered her husband. She
			never forgot anything she had once decided to do. Her
			manner of following it up grew more chilly, but never
			weaker. To-night there was no spring in Percy. He closed his
			eyes and replied without moving:</p>

			<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t go. You had better telephone the Burks we aren&#8217;t
			coming. I have to tell you something disagreeable.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Stella rose.</p>

			<p>&#8220;I certainly am not going to disappoint the Burks and stay
			at home to talk about anything disagreeable.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re not very sympathetic, Stella.&#8221;</p>

			<p>She turned away.</p>

			<p>&#8220;If I were, you&#8217;d soon settle down into a pretty dull proposition.
			We&#8217;d have no social life now if I didn&#8217;t keep at you.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Percy roused himself a little.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Social life? Well, we&#8217;ll have to trim that pretty close for a
			while. I&#8217;m in debt to the company. We&#8217;ve been living beyond
			our means ever since we were married.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;We can&#8217;t live on less than we do,&#8221; Stella said quietly. &#8220;No
			use in taking that up again.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Percy sat up, clutching the arms of his chair.</p>

			<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll have to take it up. I&#8217;m seven hundred dollars short,
			and the books are to be audited to-morrow. I told young
			Remsen and he&#8217;s going to take my note and hold the money
			out of my pay-checks. He could send me to jail, of course.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Stella turned and looked down at him with a gleam of
			interest.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Oh, you&#8217;ve been playing solitaire with the books, have
			you? And he&#8217;s found you out! I hope I&#8217;ll never see that man
			again. Sugar face!&#8221; She said this with intense acrimony. Her
			forehead flushed delicately, and her eyes were full of hate.
			Young Remsen was not her idea of a &#8220;business man.&#8221;</p>

			<p><a class="pagenum" id="page160" title="160">&nbsp;</a>Stella went into the other room. When she came back she
			wore her evening coat and carried long gloves and a black
			scarf. This she began to arrange over her hair before the mirror
			above the false fireplace. Percy lay inert in the Morris chair
			and watched her. Yes, he understood; it was very difficult for
			a woman with hair like that to be shabby and to go without
			things. Her hair made her conspicuous, and it had to be lived
			up to. It had been the deciding factor in his fate.</p>

			<p>Stella caught the lace over one ear with a large gold hairpin.
			She repeated this until she got a good effect. Then turning
			to Percy, she began to draw on her gloves.</p>

			<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not worrying any, because I&#8217;m going back into business,&#8221;
			she said firmly. &#8220;I meant to, anyway, if you didn&#8217;t get a
			raise the first of the year. I have the offer of a good position,
			and we can live in an apartment hotel.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Percy was on his feet in an instant.</p>

			<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t have you grinding in any office. That&#8217;s flat.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Stella&#8217;s lower lip quivered in a commiserating smile. &#8220;Oh, I
			won&#8217;t lose my health. Charley Greengay&#8217;s a partner in his
			concern now, and he wants a private secretary.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Percy drew back.</p>

			<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t work for Greengay. He&#8217;s got too bad a reputation.
			You&#8217;ve more pride than that, Stella.&#8221;</p>

			<p>The thin sweep of color he knew so well went over Stella&#8217;s
			face.</p>

			<p>&#8220;His business reputation seems to be all right,&#8221; she commented,
			working the kid on with her left hand.</p>

			<p>&#8220;What if it is?&#8221; Percy broke out. &#8220;He&#8217;s the cheapest kind of
			a skate. He gets into scrapes with the girls in his own office.
			The last one got into the newspapers, and he had to pay the
			girl a wad.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;He don&#8217;t get into scrapes with his books, anyway, and he
			seems to be able to stand getting into the papers. I excuse
			Charley. His wife&#8217;s a pill.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;I suppose you think he&#8217;d have been all right if he&#8217;d married
			you,&#8221; said Percy, bitterly.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Yes, I do.&#8221; Stella buttoned her glove with an air of
			finishing something, and then looked at Percy without animosity.
			&#8220;Charley and I both have sporty tastes, and we like
			excitement. You might as well live in Newark if you&#8217;re going
			<a class="pagenum" id="page161" title="161">&nbsp;</a>to sit at home in the evening. You oughtn&#8217;t to have married a
			business woman; you need somebody domestic. There&#8217;s
			nothing in this sort of life for either of us.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;That means, I suppose, that you&#8217;re going around with
			Greengay and his crowd?&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;Yes, that&#8217;s my sort of crowd, and you never did fit into it.
			You&#8217;re too intellectual. I&#8217;ve always been proud of you, Percy.
			You&#8217;re better style than Charley, but that gets tiresome. You
			will never burn much red fire in New York, now, will you?&#8221;</p>

			<p>Percy did not reply. He sat looking at the minute-hand of
			the eviscerated Mission clock. His wife almost never took the
			trouble to argue with him.</p>

			<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re old style, Percy,&#8221; she went on. &#8220;Of course everybody
			marries and wishes they hadn&#8217;t, but nowadays people
			get over it. Some women go ahead on the quiet, but I&#8217;m
			giving it to you straight. I&#8217;m going to work for Greengay. I
			like his line of business, and I meet people well. Now I&#8217;m
			going to the Burks&#8217;.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Percy dropped his hands limply between his knees.</p>

			<p>&#8220;I suppose,&#8221; he brought out, &#8220;the real trouble is that
			you&#8217;ve decided my earning power is not very great.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s part of it, and part of it is you&#8217;re old-fashioned.&#8221;
			Stella paused at the door and looked back. &#8220;What made you
			rush me, anyway, Percy?&#8221; she asked indulgently. &#8220;What did
			you go and pretend to be a spender and get tied up with me
			for?&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;I guess everybody wants to be a spender when he&#8217;s in
			love,&#8221; Percy replied.</p>

			<p>Stella shook her head mournfully.</p>

			<p>&#8220;No, you&#8217;re a spender or you&#8217;re not. Greengay has been
			broke three times, fired, down and out, black-listed. But he&#8217;s
			always come back, and he always will. You will never be fired,
			but you&#8217;ll always be poor.&#8221; She turned and looked back again
			before she went out.</p>

			<hr class="thoughtbreak" />

			<p class="post_thoughtbreak">Six months later Bixby came to young Oliver Remsen one
			afternoon and said he would like to have twenty dollars a
			week held out of his pay until his debt was cleared off.</p>

			<p>Oliver looked up at his sallow employee and asked him
			how he could spare as much as that.</p>

			<p><a class="pagenum" id="page162" title="162">&nbsp;</a>&#8220;My expenses are lighter,&#8221; Bixby replied. &#8220;My wife has
			gone into business with a ready-to-wear firm. She is not living
			with me any more.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Oliver looked annoyed, and asked him if nothing could be
			done to readjust his domestic affairs. Bixby said no; they
			would probably remain as they were.</p>

			<p>&#8220;But where are you living, Bixby? How have you arranged
			things?&#8221; the young man asked impatiently.</p>

			<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m very comfortable. I live in a boarding-house and have
			my own furniture. There are several fellows there who are
			fixed the same way. Their wives went back into business, and
			they drifted apart.&#8221;</p>

			<p>With a baffled expression Remsen stared at the uneven
			shoulders under the skin-fitting alpaca desk coat as his bookkeeper
			went out. He had meant to do something for Percy,
			but somehow, he reflected, one never did do anything for a
			fellow who had been stung as hard as that.</p>

			<h3 class="story_title">Ardessa <a class="return_toc" href="#contents" title="Return to Contents">ToC</a></h3>
			<p class="first_paragraph">The grand-mannered old man who sat at a desk in the
			reception-room of &#8220;The Outcry&#8221; offices to receive visitors
			and incidentally to keep the time-book of the employees,
			looked up as Miss Devine entered at ten minutes past ten and
			condescendingly wished him good morning. He bowed profoundly
			as she minced past his desk, and with an indifferent
			air took her course down the corridor that led to the editorial
			offices. Mechanically he opened the flat, black book at his elbow
			and placed his finger on D, running his eye along the
			line of figures after the name Devine. &#8220;It&#8217;s banker&#8217;s hours she
			keeps, indeed,&#8221; he muttered. What was the use of entering so
			capricious a record? Nevertheless, with his usual preliminary
			flourish he wrote 10:10 under this, the fourth day of May.</p>

			<p>The employee who kept banker&#8217;s hours rustled on down
			the corridor to her private room, hung up her lavender jacket
			and her trim spring hat, and readjusted her side combs by the
			mirror inside her closet door. Glancing at her desk, she rang
			for an office boy, and reproved him because he had not
			dusted more carefully and because there were lumps in her
			paste. When he disappeared with the paste-jar, she sat down
			to decide which of her employer&#8217;s letters he should see and
			which he should not.</p>

			<p>Ardessa was not young and she was certainly not handsome.
			The coquettish angle at which she carried her head was
			a mannerism surviving from a time when it was more becoming.
			She shuddered at the cold candor of the new business
			woman, and was insinuatingly feminine.</p>

			<p>Ardessa&#8217;s employer, like young Lochinvar, had come out of
			the West, and he had done a great many contradictory things
			before he became proprietor and editor of &#8220;The Outcry.&#8221;
			Before he decided to go to New York and make the East
			take notice of him, O&#8217;Mally had acquired a punctual, reliable
			silver-mine in South Dakota. This silent friend in the background
			made his journalistic success comparatively easy. He
			had figured out, when he was a rich nobody in Nevada, that
			the quickest way to cut into the known world was through
			<a class="pagenum" id="page164" title="164">&nbsp;</a>the printing-press. He arrived in New York, bought a highly
			respectable publication, and turned it into a red-hot magazine
			of protest, which he called &#8220;The Outcry.&#8221; He knew what the
			West wanted, and it proved to be what everybody secretly
			wanted. In six years he had done the thing that had hitherto
			seemed impossible: built up a national weekly, out on the
			news-stands the same day in New York and San Francisco; a
			magazine the people howled for, a moving-picture film of
			their real tastes and interests.</p>

			<p>O&#8217;Mally bought &#8220;The Outcry&#8221; to make a stir, not to make
			a career, but he had got built into the thing more than he ever
			intended. It had made him a public man and put him into
			politics. He found the publicity game diverting, and it held
			him longer than any other game had ever done. He had built
			up about him an organization of which he was somewhat
			afraid and with which he was vastly bored. On his staff there
			were five famous men, and he had made every one of them.
			At first it amused him to manufacture celebrities. He found
			he could take an average reporter from the daily press, give
			him a &#8220;line&#8221; to follow, a trust to fight, a vice to expose,&#8212;this
			was all in that good time when people were eager to read
			about their own wickedness,&#8212;and in two years the reporter
			would be recognized as an authority. Other people&#8212;Napoleon,
			Disraeli, Sarah Bernhardt&#8212;had discovered that advertising
			would go a long way; but Marcus O&#8217;Mally discovered
			that in America it would go all the way&#8212;as far as you wished
			to pay its passage. Any human countenance, plastered in
			three-sheet posters from sea to sea, would be revered by the
			American people. The strangest thing was that the owners of
			these grave countenances, staring at their own faces on newsstands
			and billboards, fell to venerating themselves; and even
			he, O&#8217;Mally, was more or less constrained by these reputations
			that he had created out of cheap paper and cheap ink.</p>

			<p>Constraint was the last thing O&#8217;Mally liked. The most engaging
			and unusual thing about the man was that he couldn&#8217;t
			be fooled by the success of his own methods, and no amount
			of &#8220;recognition&#8221; could make a stuffed shirt of him. No matter
			how much he was advertised as a great medicine-man in the
			councils of the nation, he knew that he was a born gambler
			and a soldier of fortune. He left his dignified office to take
			<a class="pagenum" id="page165" title="165">&nbsp;</a>care of itself for a good many months of the year while he
			played about on the outskirts of social order. He liked being a
			great man from the East in rough-and-tumble Western cities
			where he had once been merely an unconsidered spender.</p>

			<p>O&#8217;Mally&#8217;s long absences constituted one of the supreme advantages
			of Ardessa Devine&#8217;s position. When he was at his
			post her duties were not heavy, but when he was giving balls
			in Goldfield, Nevada, she lived an ideal life. She came to the
			office every day, indeed, to forward such of O&#8217;Mally&#8217;s letters
			as she thought best, to attend to his club notices and tradesmen&#8217;s
			bills, and to taste the sense of her high connections.
			The great men of the staff were all about her, as contemplative
			as Buddhas in their private offices, each meditating upon
			the particular trust or form of vice confided to his care. Thus
			surrounded, Ardessa had a pleasant sense of being at the heart
			of things. It was like a mental massage, exercise without exertion.
			She read and she embroidered. Her room was pleasant,
			and she liked to be seen at ladylike tasks and to feel herself a
			graceful contrast to the crude girls in the advertising and
			circulation departments across the hall. The younger stenographers,
			who had to get through with the enormous office
			correspondence, and who rushed about from one editor to
			another with wire baskets full of letters, made faces as they
			passed Ardessa&#8217;s door and saw her cool and cloistered,
			daintily plying her needle. But no matter how hard the other
			stenographers were driven, no one, not even one of the
			five oracles of the staff, dared dictate so much as a letter to
			Ardessa. Like a sultan&#8217;s bride, she was inviolate in her lord&#8217;s
			absence; she had to be kept for him.</p>

			<p>Naturally the other young women employed in &#8220;The Outcry&#8221;
			offices disliked Miss Devine. They were all competent
			girls, trained in the exacting methods of modern business, and
			they had to make good every day in the week, had to get
			through with a great deal of work or lose their position.
			O&#8217;Mally&#8217;s private secretary was a mystery to them. Her exemptions
			and privileges, her patronizing remarks, formed an
			exhaustless subject of conversation at the lunch-hour. Ardessa
			had, indeed, as they knew she must have, a kind of &#8220;purchase&#8221;
			on her employer.</p>

			<p>When O&#8217;Mally first came to New York to break into publicity,
			<a class="pagenum" id="page166" title="166">&nbsp;</a>he engaged Miss Devine upon the recommendation of
			the editor whose ailing publication he bought and rechristened.
			That editor was a conservative, scholarly gentleman of
			the old school, who was retiring because he felt out of place
			in the world of brighter, breezier magazines that had been
			flowering since the new century came in. He believed that in
			this vehement world young O&#8217;Mally would make himself
			heard and that Miss Devine&#8217;s training in an editorial office
			would be of use to him.</p>

			<p>When O&#8217;Mally first sat down at a desk to be an editor, all
			the cards that were brought in looked pretty much alike to
			him. Ardessa was at his elbow. She had long been steeped in
			literary distinctions and in the social distinctions which used
			to count for much more than they do now. She knew all the
			great men, all the nephews and clients of great men. She
			knew which must be seen, which must be made welcome, and
			which could safely be sent away. She could give O&#8217;Mally on
			the instant the former rating in magazine offices of nearly
			every name that was brought in to him. She could give him
			an idea of the man&#8217;s connections, of the price his work commanded,
			and insinuate whether he ought to be met with the
			old punctiliousness or with the new joviality. She was useful
			in explaining to her employer the significance of various invitations,
			and the standing of clubs and associations. At first she
			was virtually the social mentor of the bullet-headed young
			Westerner who wanted to break into everything, the solitary
			person about the office of the humming new magazine who
			knew anything about the editorial traditions of the eighties
			and nineties which, antiquated as they now were, gave an
			editor, as O&#8217;Mally said, a background.</p>

			<p>Despite her indolence, Ardessa was useful to O&#8217;Mally as a
			social reminder. She was the card catalogue of his ever-changing
			personal relations. O&#8217;Mally went in for everything
			and got tired of everything; that was why he made a good
			editor. After he was through with people, Ardessa was very
			skilful in covering his retreat. She read and answered the letters
			of admirers who had begun to bore him. When great
			authors, who had been dined and fêted the month before,
			were suddenly left to cool their heels in the reception-room,
			thrown upon the suave hospitality of the grand old man at
			<a class="pagenum" id="page167" title="167">&nbsp;</a>the desk, it was Ardessa who went out and made soothing
			and plausible explanations as to why the editor could not see
			them. She was the brake that checked the too-eager neophyte,
			the emollient that eased the severing of relationships, the gentle
			extinguisher of the lights that failed. When there were no
			longer messages of hope and cheer to be sent to ardent young
			writers and reformers, Ardessa delivered, as sweetly as possible,
			whatever messages were left.</p>

			<p>In handling these people with whom O&#8217;Mally was quite
			through, Ardessa had gradually developed an industry which
			was immensely gratifying to her own vanity. Not only did she
			not crush them; she even fostered them a little. She continued
			to advise them in the reception-room and &#8220;personally&#8221; received
			their manuscripts long after O&#8217;Mally had declared that
			he would never read another line they wrote. She let them
			outline their plans for stories and articles to her, promising to
			bring these suggestions to the editor&#8217;s attention. She denied
			herself to nobody, was gracious even to the Shakspere-Bacon
			man, the perpetual-motion man, the travel-article man, the
			ghosts which haunt every magazine office. The writers who
			had had their happy hour of O&#8217;Mally&#8217;s favor kept feeling that
			Ardessa might reinstate them. She answered their letters of
			inquiry in her most polished and elegant style, and even gave
			them hints as to the subjects in which the restless editor was
			or was not interested at the moment: she feared it would be
			useless to send him an article on &#8220;How to Trap Lions,&#8221; because
			he had just bought an article on &#8220;Elephant-Shooting in
			Majuba Land,&#8221; etc.</p>

			<p>So when O&#8217;Mally plunged into his office at 11:30 on this,
			the fourth day of May, having just got back from three-days&#8217;
			fishing, he found Ardessa in the reception-room, surrounded
			by a little court of discards. This was annoying, for he always
			wanted his stenographer at once. Telling the office boy to give
			her a hint that she was needed, he threw off his hat and topcoat
			and began to race through the pile of letters Ardessa had
			put on his desk. When she entered, he did not wait for her
			polite inquiries about his trip, but broke in at once.</p>

			<p>&#8220;What is that fellow who writes about phossy jaw still
			hanging round here for? I don&#8217;t want any articles on phossy
			jaw, and if I did, I wouldn&#8217;t want his.&#8221;</p>

			<p><a class="pagenum" id="page168" title="168">&nbsp;</a>&#8220;He has just sold an article on the match industry to &#8216;The
			New Age,&#8217; Mr. O&#8217;Mally,&#8221; Ardessa replied as she took her seat
			at the editor&#8217;s right.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Why does he have to come and tell us about it? We&#8217;ve
			nothing to do with &#8216;The New Age.&#8217; And that prison-reform
			guy, what&#8217;s he loafing about for?&#8221;</p>

			<p>Ardessa bridled.</p>

			<p>&#8220;You remember, Mr. O&#8217;Mally, he brought letters of introduction
			from Governor Harper, the reform Governor of
			Mississippi.&#8221;</p>

			<p>O&#8217;Mally jumped up, kicking over his waste-basket in his
			impatience.</p>

			<p>&#8220;That was months ago. I went through his letters and went
			through him, too. He hasn&#8217;t got anything we want. I&#8217;ve been
			through with Governor Harper a long while. We&#8217;re asleep at
			the switch in here. And let me tell you, if I catch sight of that
			causes-of-blindness-in-babies woman around here again, I&#8217;ll
			do something violent. Clear them out, Miss Devine! Clear
			them out! We need a traffic policeman in this office. Have you
			got that article on &#8216;Stealing Our National Water Power&#8217; ready
			for me?&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;Mr. Gerrard took it back to make modifications. He gave
			it to me at noon on Saturday, just before the office closed. I
			will have it ready for you to-morrow morning, Mr. O&#8217;Mally,
			if you have not too many letters for me this afternoon,&#8221; Ardessa
			replied pointedly.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Holy Mike!&#8221; muttered O&#8217;Mally, &#8220;we need a traffic policeman
			for the staff, too. Gerrard&#8217;s modified that thing half a
			dozen times already. Why don&#8217;t they get accurate information
			in the first place?&#8221;</p>

			<p>He began to dictate his morning mail, walking briskly up
			and down the floor by way of giving his stenographer an energetic
			example. Her indolence and her ladylike deportment
			weighed on him. He wanted to take her by the elbows and
			run her around the block. He didn&#8217;t mind that she loafed
			when he was away, but it was becoming harder and harder to
			speed her up when he was on the spot. He knew his correspondence
			was not enough to keep her busy, so when he was
			in town he made her type his own breezy editorials and various
			articles by members of his staff.</p>

			<p><a class="pagenum" id="page169" title="169">&nbsp;</a>Transcribing editorial copy is always laborious, and the
			only way to make it easy is to farm it out. This Ardessa was
			usually clever enough to do. When she returned to her own
			room after O&#8217;Mally had gone out to lunch, Ardessa rang for
			an office boy and said languidly, &#8220;James, call Becky, please.&#8221;</p>

			<p>In a moment a thin, tense-faced Hebrew girl of eighteen or
			nineteen came rushing in, carrying a wire basket full of typewritten
			sheets. She was as gaunt as a plucked spring chicken,
			and her cheap, gaudy clothes might have been thrown on her.
			She looked as if she were running to catch a train and in
			mortal dread of missing it. While Miss Devine examined the
			pages in the basket, Becky stood with her shoulders drawn up
			and her elbows drawn in, apparently trying to hide herself in
			her insufficient open-work waist. Her wild, black eyes followed
			Miss Devine&#8217;s hands desperately. Ardessa sighed.</p>

			<p>&#8220;This seems to be very smeary copy again, Becky. You
			don&#8217;t keep your mind on your work, and so you have to erase
			continually.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Becky spoke up in wailing self-vindication.</p>

			<p>&#8220;It ain&#8217;t that, Miss Devine. It&#8217;s so many hard words he uses
			that I have to be at the dictionary all the time. Look! Look!&#8221;
			She produced a bunch of manuscript faintly scrawled in pencil,
			and thrust it under Ardessa&#8217;s eyes. &#8220;He don&#8217;t write out the
			words at all. He just begins a word, and then makes waves for
			you to guess.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;I see you haven&#8217;t always guessed correctly, Becky,&#8221; said
			Ardessa, with a weary smile. &#8220;There are a great many words
			here that would surprise Mr. Gerrard, I am afraid.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;And the inserts,&#8221; Becky persisted. &#8220;How is anybody to tell
			where they go, Miss Devine? It&#8217;s mostly inserts; see, all over
			the top and sides and back.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Ardessa turned her head away.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t claw the pages like that, Becky. You make me nervous.
			Mr. Gerrard has not time to dot his i&#8217;s and cross his t&#8217;s.
			That is what we keep copyists for. I will correct these sheets
			for you,&#8212;it would be terrible if Mr. O&#8217;Mally saw them,&#8212;and
			then you can copy them over again. It must be done by
			to-morrow morning, so you may have to work late. See that
			your hands are clean and dry, and then you will not smear it.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;Yes, ma&#8217;am. Thank you, Miss Devine. Will you tell the
			<a class="pagenum" id="page170" title="170">&nbsp;</a>janitor, please, it&#8217;s all right if I have to stay? He was cross
			because I was here Saturday afternoon doing this. He said it
			was a holiday, and when everybody else was gone I ought
			to&#8212;&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;That will do, Becky. Yes, I will speak to the janitor for
			you. You may go to lunch now.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Becky turned on one heel and then swung back.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Miss Devine,&#8221; she said anxiously, &#8220;will it be all right if I
			get white shoes for now?&#8221;</p>

			<p>Ardessa gave her kind consideration.</p>

			<p>&#8220;For office wear, you mean? No, Becky. With only one
			pair, you could not keep them properly clean; and black shoes
			are much less conspicuous. Tan, if you prefer.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Becky looked down at her feet. They were too large, and
			her skirt was as much too short as her legs were too long.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Nearly all the girls I know wear white shoes to business,&#8221;
			she pleaded.</p>

			<p>&#8220;They are probably little girls who work in factories or department
			stores, and that is quite another matter. Since you
			raise the question, Becky, I ought to speak to you about your
			new waist. Don&#8217;t wear it to the office again, please. Those
			cheap open-work waists are not appropriate in an office like
			this. They are all very well for little chorus girls.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;But Miss Kalski wears expensive waists to business more
			open than this, and jewelry&#8212;&#8221;</p>

			<p>Ardessa interrupted. Her face grew hard.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Miss Kalski,&#8221; she said coldly, &#8220;works for the business department.
			You are employed in the editorial offices. There is a
			great difference. You see, Becky, I might have to call you in
			here at any time when a scientist or a great writer or the
			president of a university is here talking over editorial matters,
			and such clothes as you have on to-day would make a bad
			impression. Nearly all our connections are with important
			people of that kind, and we ought to be well, but quietly,
			dressed.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;Yes, Miss Devine. Thank you,&#8221; Becky gasped and disappeared.
			Heaven knew she had no need to be further impressed
			with the greatness of &#8220;The Outcry&#8221; office. During
			the year and a half she had been there she had never ceased to
			tremble. She knew the prices all the authors got as well as
			<a class="pagenum" id="page171" title="171">&nbsp;</a>Miss Devine did, and everything seemed to her to be done on
			a magnificent scale. She hadn&#8217;t a good memory for long technical
			words, but she never forgot dates or prices or initials or
			telephone numbers.</p>

			<p>Becky felt that her job depended on Miss Devine, and she
			was so glad to have it that she scarcely realized she was being
			bullied. Besides, she was grateful for all that she had learned
			from Ardessa; Ardessa had taught her to do most of the
			things that she was supposed to do herself. Becky wanted to
			learn, she had to learn; that was the train she was always running
			for. Her father, Isaac Tietelbaum, the tailor, who pressed
			Miss Devine&#8217;s skirts and kept her ladylike suits in order, had
			come to his client two years ago and told her he had a bright
			girl just out of a commercial high school. He implored Ardessa
			to find some office position for his daughter. Ardessa told
			an appealing story to O&#8217;Mally, and brought Becky into the
			office, at a salary of six dollars a week, to help with the copying
			and to learn business routine. When Becky first came she
			was as ignorant as a young savage. She was rapid at her shorthand
			and typing, but a Kafir girl would have known as much
			about the English language. Nobody ever wanted to learn
			more than Becky. She fairly wore the dictionary out. She dug
			up her old school grammar and worked over it at night. She
			faithfully mastered Miss Devine&#8217;s fussy system of punctuation.</p>

			<p>There were eight children at home, younger than Becky,
			and they were all eager to learn. They wanted to get their
			mother out of the three dark rooms behind the tailor shop
			and to move into a flat up-stairs, where they could, as Becky
			said, &#8220;live private.&#8221; The young Tietelbaums doubted their father&#8217;s
			ability to bring this change about, for the more things
			he declared himself ready to do in his window placards, the
			fewer were brought to him to be done. &#8220;Dyeing, Cleaning,
			Ladies&#8217; Furs Remodeled&#8221;&#8212;it did no good.</p>

			<p>Rebecca was out to &#8220;improve herself,&#8221; as her father had
			told her she must. Ardessa had easy way with her. It was one
			of those rare relationships from which both persons profit.
			The more Becky could learn from Ardessa, the happier she
			was; and the more Ardessa could unload on Becky, the
			greater was her contentment. She easily broke Becky of the
			gum-chewing habit, taught her to walk quietly, to efface herself
			<a class="pagenum" id="page172" title="172">&nbsp;</a>at the proper moment, and to hold her tongue. Becky had
			been raised to eight dollars a week; but she didn&#8217;t care half so
			much about that as she did about her own increasing efficiency.
			The more work Miss Devine handed over to her the
			happier she was, and the faster she was able to eat it up. She
			tested and tried herself in every possible way. She now had
			full confidence that she would surely one day be a high-priced
			stenographer, a real &#8220;business woman.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Becky would have corrupted a really industrious person,
			but a bilious temperament like Ardessa&#8217;s couldn&#8217;t make even
			a feeble stand against such willingness. Ardessa had grown
			soft and had lost the knack of turning out work. Sometimes,
			in her importance and serenity, she shivered. What if O&#8217;Mally
			should die, and she were thrust out into the world to work in
			competition with the brazen, competent young women she
			saw about her everywhere? She believed herself indispensable,
			but she knew that in such a mischanceful world as this the
			very powers of darkness might rise to separate her from this
			pearl among jobs.</p>

			<p>When Becky came in from lunch she went down the long hall
			to the wash-room, where all the little girls who worked in
			the advertising and circulation departments kept their hats
			and jackets. There were shelves and shelves of bright spring
			hats, piled on top of one another, all as stiff as sheet-iron and
			trimmed with gay flowers. At the marble wash-stand stood
			Rena Kalski, the right bower of the business manager, polishing
			her diamond rings with a nail-brush.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Hullo, kid,&#8221; she called over her shoulder to Becky. &#8220;I&#8217;ve
			got a ticket for you for Thursday afternoon.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Becky&#8217;s black eyes glowed, but the strained look on her
			face drew tighter than ever.</p>

			<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll never ask her, Miss Kalski,&#8221; she said rapidly. &#8220;I don&#8217;t
			dare. I have to stay late to-night again; and I know she&#8217;d be
			hard to please after, if I was to try to get off on a week-day. I
			thank you, Miss Kalski, but I&#8217;d better not.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Miss Kalski laughed. She was a slender young Hebrew,
			handsome in an impudent, Tenderloin sort of way, with a
			small head, reddish-brown almond eyes, a trifle tilted, a rapacious
			mouth, and a beautiful chin.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Ain&#8217;t you under that woman&#8217;s thumb, though! Call her
			<a class="pagenum" id="page173" title="173">&nbsp;</a>bluff. She isn&#8217;t half the prima donna she thinks she is. On my
			side of the hall we know who&#8217;s who about this place.&#8221;</p>

			<p>The business and editorial departments of &#8220;The Outcry&#8221;
			were separated by a long corridor and a great contempt. Miss
			Kalski dried her rings with tissue-paper and studied them
			with an appraising eye.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Well, since you&#8217;re such a &#8217;fraidy-calf,&#8217;&#8221; she went on,
			&#8220;maybe I can get a rise out of her myself. Now I&#8217;ve got you a
			ticket out of that shirt-front, I want you to go. I&#8217;ll drop in on
			Devine this afternoon.&#8221;</p>

			<p>When Miss Kalski went back to her desk in the business
			manager&#8217;s private office, she turned to him familiarly, but not
			impertinently.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Mr. Henderson, I want to send a kid over in the editorial
			stenographers&#8217; to the Palace Thursday afternoon. She&#8217;s a nice
			kid, only she&#8217;s scared out of her skin all the time. Miss
			Devine&#8217;s her boss, and she&#8217;ll be just mean enough not to let
			the young one off. Would you say a word to her?&#8221;</p>

			<p>The business manager lit a cigar.</p>

			<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not saying words to any of the high-brows over there.
			Try it out with Devine yourself. You&#8217;re not bashful.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Miss Kalski shrugged her shoulders and smiled.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Oh, very well.&#8221; She serpentined out of the room and
			crossed the Rubicon into the editorial offices. She found Ardessa
			typing O&#8217;Mally&#8217;s letters and wearing a pained expression.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Good afternoon, Miss Devine,&#8221; she said carelessly. &#8220;Can
			we borrow Becky over there for Thursday afternoon? We&#8217;re
			short.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Miss Devine looked piqued and tilted her head.</p>

			<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s customary, Miss Kalski, for the business
			department to use our people. We never have girls enough
			here to do the work. Of course if Mr. Henderson feels justified&#8212;&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;Thanks awfully, Miss Devine,&#8221;&#8212;Miss Kalski interrupted
			her with the perfectly smooth, good-natured tone which
			never betrayed a hint of the scorn every line of her sinuous
			figure expressed,&#8212;&#8220;I will tell Mr. Henderson. Perhaps we
			can do something for you some day.&#8221; Whether this was a
			threat, a kind wish, or an insinuation, no mortal could have
			told. Miss Kalski&#8217;s face was always suggesting insolence without
			<a class="pagenum" id="page174" title="174">&nbsp;</a>being quite insolent. As she returned to her own domain
			she met the cashier&#8217;s head clerk in the hall. &#8220;That Devine
			woman&#8217;s a crime,&#8221; she murmured. The head clerk laughed
			tolerantly.</p>

			<p>That afternoon as Miss Kalski was leaving the office at 5:15,
			on her way down the corridor she heard a typewriter clicking
			away in the empty, echoing editorial offices. She looked in,
			and found Becky bending forward over the machine as if she
			were about to swallow it.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Hello, kid. Do you sleep with that?&#8221; she called. She
			walked up to Becky and glanced at her copy. &#8220;What do you
			let &#8217;em keep you up nights over that stuff for?&#8221; she asked
			contemptuously. &#8220;The world wouldn&#8217;t suffer if that stuff
			never got printed.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Rebecca looked up wildly. Not even Miss Kalski&#8217;s French
			pansy hat or her ear-rings and landscape veil could loosen
			Becky&#8217;s tenacious mind from Mr. Gerrard&#8217;s article on water
			power. She scarcely knew what Miss Kalski had said to her,
			certainly not what she meant.</p>

			<p>&#8220;But I must make progress already, Miss Kalski,&#8221; she
			panted.</p>

			<p>Miss Kalski gave her low, siren laugh.</p>

			<p>&#8220;I should say you must!&#8221; she ejaculated.</p>

			<hr class="thoughtbreak" />

			<p class="post_thoughtbreak">Ardessa decided to take her vacation in June, and she
			arranged that Miss Milligan should do O&#8217;Mally&#8217;s work
			while she was away. Miss Milligan was blunt and noisy,
			rapid and inaccurate. It would be just as well for O&#8217;Mally to
			work with a coarse instrument for a time; he would be more
			appreciative, perhaps, of certain qualities to which he had
			seemed insensible of late. Ardessa was to leave for East
			Hampton on Sunday, and she spent Saturday morning instructing
			her substitute as to the state of the correspondence.
			At noon O&#8217;Mally burst into her room. All the morning he
			had been closeted with a new writer of mystery-stories just
			over from England.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Can you stay and take my letters this afternoon, Miss
			Devine? You&#8217;re not leaving until to-morrow.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Ardessa pouted, and tilted her head at the angle he was
			tired of.</p>

			<p><a class="pagenum" id="page175" title="175">&nbsp;</a>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry, Mr. O&#8217;Mally, but I&#8217;ve left all my shopping for
			this afternoon. I think Becky Tietelbaum could do them for
			you. I will tell her to be careful.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;Oh, all right.&#8221; O&#8217;Mally bounced out with a reflection of
			Ardessa&#8217;s disdainful expression on his face. Saturday afternoon
			was always a half-holiday, to be sure, but since she had
			weeks of freedom when he was away&#8212;However&#8212;</p>

			<p>At two o&#8217;clock Becky Tietelbaum appeared at his door, clad
			in the sober office suit which Miss Devine insisted she should
			wear, her note-book in her hand, and so frightened that her
			fingers were cold and her lips were pale. She had never taken
			dictation from the editor before. It was a great and terrifying
			occasion.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Sit down,&#8221; he said encouragingly. He began dictating
			while he shook from his bag the manuscripts he had snatched
			away from the amazed English author that morning. Presently
			he looked up.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Do I go too fast?&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;No, sir,&#8221; Becky found strength to say.</p>

			<p>At the end of an hour he told her to go and type as many
			of the letters as she could while he went over the bunch of
			stuff he had torn from the Englishman. He was with the
			Hindu detective in an opium den in Shanghai when Becky
			returned and placed a pile of papers on his desk.</p>

			<p>&#8220;How many?&#8221; he asked, without looking up.</p>

			<p>&#8220;All you gave me, sir.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;All, so soon? Wait a minute and let me see how many
			mistakes.&#8221; He went over the letters rapidly, signing them as
			he read. &#8220;They seem to be all right. I thought you were the
			girl that made so many mistakes.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Rebecca was never too frightened to vindicate herself.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Mr. O&#8217;Mally, sir, I don&#8217;t make mistakes with letters. It&#8217;s
			only copying the articles that have so many long words, and
			when the writing isn&#8217;t plain, like Mr. Gerrard&#8217;s. I never make
			many mistakes with Mr. Johnson&#8217;s articles, or with yours I
			don&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

			<p>O&#8217;Mally wheeled round in his chair, looked with curiosity
			at her long, tense face, her black eyes, and straight brows.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Oh, so you sometimes copy articles, do you? How does
			that happen?&#8221;</p>

			<p><a class="pagenum" id="page176" title="176">&nbsp;</a>&#8220;Yes, sir. Always Miss Devine gives me the articles to do.
			It&#8217;s good practice for me.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;I see.&#8221; O&#8217;Mally shrugged his shoulders. He was thinking
			that he could get a rise out of the whole American public any
			day easier than he could get a rise out of Ardessa. &#8220;What
			editorials of mine have you copied lately, for instance?&#8221;</p>

			<p>Rebecca blazed out at him, reciting rapidly:</p>

			<p>&#8220;Oh, &#8216;A Word about the Rosenbaums,&#8217; &#8216;Useless Navy-Yards,&#8217;
			&#8216;Who Killed Cock Robin&#8217;&#8212;&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;Wait a minute.&#8221; O&#8217;Mally checked her flow. &#8220;What was
			that one about&#8212;Cock Robin?&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;It was all about why the secretary of the interior dismissed&#8212;&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;All right, all right. Copy those letters, and put them down
			the chute as you go out. Come in here for a minute on Monday
			morning.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Becky hurried home to tell her father that she had taken the
			editor&#8217;s letters and had made no mistakes. On Monday she
			learned that she was to do O&#8217;Mally&#8217;s work for a few days. He
			disliked Miss Milligan, and he was annoyed with Ardessa for
			trying to put her over on him when there was better material
			at hand. With Rebecca he got on very well; she was impersonal,
			unreproachful, and she fairly panted for work. Everything
			was done almost before he told her what he wanted.
			She raced ahead with him; it was like riding a good modern
			bicycle after pumping along on an old hard tire.</p>

			<p>On the day before Miss Devine&#8217;s return O&#8217;Mally strolled
			over for a chat with the business office.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Henderson, your people are taking vacations now, I suppose?
			Could you use an extra girl?&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;If it&#8217;s that thin black one, I can.&#8221;</p>

			<p>O&#8217;Mally gave him a wise smile.</p>

			<p>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t. To be honest, I want to put one over on you. I
			want you to take Miss Devine over here for a while and speed
			her up. I can&#8217;t do anything. She&#8217;s got the upper hand of me. I
			don&#8217;t want to fire her, you understand, but she makes my life
			too difficult. It&#8217;s my fault, of course. I&#8217;ve pampered her. Give
			her a chance over here; maybe she&#8217;ll come back. You can be
			firm with &#8217;em, can&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

			<p>Henderson glanced toward the desk where Miss Kalski&#8217;s
			<a class="pagenum" id="page177" title="177">&nbsp;</a>lightning eye was skimming over the printing-house bills that
			he was supposed to verify himself.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Well, if I can&#8217;t, I know who can,&#8221; he replied, with a
			chuckle.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Exactly,&#8221; O&#8217;Mally agreed. &#8220;I&#8217;m counting on the force of
			Miss Kalski&#8217;s example. Miss Devine&#8217;s all right, Miss Kalski,
			but she needs regular exercise. She owes it to her complexion.
			I can&#8217;t discipline people.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Miss Kalski&#8217;s only reply was a low, indulgent laugh.</p>

			<p>O&#8217;Mally braced himself on the morning of Ardessa&#8217;s return.
			He told the waiter at his club to bring him a second pot of
			coffee and to bring it hot. He was really afraid of her. When
			she presented herself at his office at 10:30 he complimented
			her upon her tan and asked about her vacation. Then he
			broke the news to her.</p>

			<p>&#8220;We want to make a few temporary changes about here,
			Miss Devine, for the summer months. The business department
			is short of help. Henderson is going to put Miss Kalski
			on the books for a while to figure out some economies for
			him, and he is going to take you over. Meantime I&#8217;ll get
			Becky broken in so that she could take your work if you were
			sick or anything.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Ardessa drew herself up.</p>

			<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve not been accustomed to commercial work, Mr.
			O&#8217;Mally. I&#8217;ve no interest in it, and I don&#8217;t care to brush up in
			it.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;Brushing up is just what we need, Miss Devine.&#8221; O&#8217;Mally
			began tramping about his room expansively. &#8220;I&#8217;m going to
			brush everybody up. I&#8217;m going to brush a few people out;
			but I want you to stay with us, of course. You belong here.
			Don&#8217;t be hasty now. Go to your room and think it over.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Ardessa was beginning to cry, and O&#8217;Mally was afraid he
			would lose his nerve. He looked out of the window at a new
			sky-scraper that was building, while she retired without a
			word.</p>

			<p>At her own desk Ardessa sat down breathless and trembling.
			The one thing she had never doubted was her unique
			value to O&#8217;Mally. She had, as she told herself, taught him
			everything. She would say a few things to Becky Tietelbaum,
			and to that pigeon-breasted tailor, her father, too! The worst
			<a class="pagenum" id="page178" title="178">&nbsp;</a>of it was that Ardessa had herself brought it all about; she
			could see that clearly now. She had carefully trained and qualified
			her successor. Why had she ever civilized Becky? Why
			had she taught her manners and deportment, broken her of
			the gum-chewing habit, and made her presentable? In her
			original state O&#8217;Mally would never have put up with her, no
			matter what her ability.</p>

			<p>Ardessa told herself that O&#8217;Mally was notoriously fickle;
			Becky amused him, but he would soon find out her limitations.
			The wise thing, she knew, was to humor him; but it
			seemed to her that she could not swallow her pride. Ardessa
			grew yellower within the hour. Over and over in her mind
			she bade O&#8217;Mally a cold adieu and minced out past the grand
			old man at the desk for the last time. But each exit she rehearsed
			made her feel sorrier for herself. She thought over all
			the offices she knew, but she realized that she could never
			meet their inexorable standards of efficiency.</p>

			<p>While she was bitterly deliberating, O&#8217;Mally himself wandered
			in, rattling his keys nervously in his pocket. He shut the
			door behind him.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Now, you&#8217;re going to come through with this all right,
			aren&#8217;t you, Miss Devine? I want Henderson to get over the
			notion that my people over here are stuck up and think the
			business department are old shoes. That&#8217;s where we get our
			money from, as he often reminds me. You&#8217;ll be the best-paid
			girl over there; no reduction, of course. You don&#8217;t want to go
			wandering off to some new office where personality doesn&#8217;t
			count for anything.&#8221; He sat down confidentially on the edge
			of her desk. &#8220;Do you, now, Miss Devine?&#8221;</p>

			<p>Ardessa simpered tearfully as she replied.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Mr. O&#8217;Mally,&#8221; she brought out, &#8220;you&#8217;ll soon find that
			Becky is not the sort of girl to meet people for you when you
			are away. I don&#8217;t see how you can think of letting her.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s one thing I want to change, Miss Devine. You&#8217;re
			too soft-handed with the has-beens and the never-was-ers.
			You&#8217;re too much of a lady for this rough game. Nearly everybody
			who comes in here wants to sell us a gold-brick, and
			you treat them as if they were bringing in wedding presents.
			Becky is as rough as sandpaper, and she&#8217;ll clear out a lot of
			dead wood.&#8221; O&#8217;Mally rose, and tapped Ardessa&#8217;s shrinking
			<a class="pagenum" id="page179" title="179">&nbsp;</a>shoulder. &#8220;Now, be a sport and go through with it, Miss
			Devine. I&#8217;ll see that you don&#8217;t lose. Henderson thinks you&#8217;ll
			refuse to do his work, so I want you to get moved in there
			before he comes back from lunch. I&#8217;ve had a desk put in his
			office for you. Miss Kalski is in the bookkeeper&#8217;s room half
			the time now.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Rena Kalski was amazed that afternoon when a line
			of office boys entered, carrying Miss Devine&#8217;s effects, and
			when Ardessa herself coldly followed them. After Ardessa
			had arranged her desk, Miss Kalski went over to her and
			told her about some matters of routine very good-naturedly.
			Ardessa looked pretty badly shaken up, and Rena bore no
			grudges.</p>

			<p>&#8220;When you want the dope on the correspondence with the
			paper men, don&#8217;t bother to look it up. I&#8217;ve got it all in my
			head, and I can save time for you. If he wants you to go over
			the printing bills every week, you&#8217;d better let me help you
			with that for a while. I can stay almost any afternoon. It&#8217;s
			quite a trick to figure out the plates and over-time charges till
			you get used to it. I&#8217;ve worked out a quick method that saves
			trouble.&#8221;</p>

			<p>When Henderson came in at three he found Ardessa, chilly,
			but civil, awaiting his instructions. He knew she disapproved
			of his tastes and his manners, but he didn&#8217;t mind. What interested
			and amused him was that Rena Kalski, whom he
			had always thought as cold-blooded as an adding-machine,
			seemed to be making a hair-mattress of herself to break Ardessa&#8217;s
			fall.</p>

			<p>At five o&#8217;clock, when Ardessa rose to go, the business manager
			said breezily:</p>

			<p>&#8220;See you at nine in the morning, Miss Devine. We begin on
			the stroke.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Ardessa faded out of the door, and Miss Kalski&#8217;s slender
			back squirmed with amusement.</p>

			<p>&#8220;I never thought to hear such words spoken,&#8221; she admitted;
			&#8220;but I guess she&#8217;ll limber up all right. The atmosphere is
			bad over there. They get moldy.&#8221;</p>

			<hr class="thoughtbreak" />

			<p class="post_thoughtbreak">After the next monthly luncheon of the heads of departments,
			O&#8217;Mally said to Henderson, as he feed the coat-boy:</p>

			<p><a class="pagenum" id="page180" title="180">&nbsp;</a>&#8220;By the way, how are you making it with the bartered
			bride?&#8221;</p>

			<p>Henderson smashed on his Panama as he said:</p>

			<p>&#8220;Any time you want her back, don&#8217;t be delicate.&#8221;</p>

			<p>But O&#8217;Mally shook his red head and laughed.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m no Indian giver!&#8221;</p>

			<h4>I</h4>
			<p class="first_paragraph">Paul Wanning opened the front door of his house in
			Orange, closed it softly behind him, and stood looking
			about the hall as he drew off his gloves.</p>

			<p>Nothing was changed there since last night, and yet he
			stood gazing about him with an interest which a long-married
			man does not often feel in his own reception hall. The rugs,
			the two pillars, the Spanish tapestry chairs, were all the same.
			The Venus di Medici stood on her column as usual and there,
			at the end of the hall (opposite the front door), was the full-length
			portrait of Mrs. Wanning, maturely blooming forth in
			an evening gown, signed with the name of a French painter
			who seemed purposely to have made his signature indistinct.
			Though the signature was largely what one paid for, one
			couldn&#8217;t ask him to do it over.</p>

			<p>In the dining room the colored man was moving about
			the table set for dinner, under the electric cluster. The candles
			had not yet been lighted. Wanning watched him with a
			homesick feeling in his heart. They had had Sam a long
			while, twelve years, now. His warm hall, the lighted dining-room,
			the drawing room where only the flicker of the wood
			fire played upon the shining surfaces of many objects&#8212;they
			seemed to Wanning like a haven of refuge. It had never
			occurred to him that his house was too full of things. He
			often said, and he believed, that the women of his household
			had &#8220;perfect taste.&#8221; He had paid for these objects, sometimes
			with difficulty, but always with pride. He carried a
			heavy life-insurance and permitted himself to spend most of
			the income from a good law practise. He wished, during his
			life-time, to enjoy the benefits of his wife&#8217;s discriminating
			extravagance.</p>

			<p>Yesterday Wanning&#8217;s doctor had sent him to a specialist.
			Today the specialist, after various laboratory tests, had told
			him most disconcerting things about the state of very necessary,
			but hitherto wholly uninteresting, organs of his body.</p>

			<p>The information pointed to something incredible; insinuated
			that his residence in this house was only temporary; that
			<a class="pagenum" id="page182" title="182">&nbsp;</a>he, whose time was so full, might have to leave not only his
			house and his office and his club, but a world with which he
			was extremely well satisfied&#8212;the only world he knew anything
			about.</p>

			<p>Wanning unbuttoned his overcoat, but did not take it off.
			He stood folding his muffler slowly and carefully. What he
			did not understand was, how he could go while other people
			stayed. Sam would be moving about the table like this, Mrs.
			Wanning and her daughters would be dressing upstairs, when
			he would not be coming home to dinner any more; when he
			would not, indeed, be dining anywhere.</p>

			<p>Sam, coming to turn on the parlor lights, saw Wanning and
			stepped behind him to take his coat.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Good evening, Mr. Wanning, sah, excuse me. You entahed
			so quietly, sah, I didn&#8217;t heah you.&#8221;</p>

			<p>The master of the house slipped out of his coat and went
			languidly upstairs.</p>

			<p>He tapped at the door of his wife&#8217;s room, which stood
			ajar.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Come in, Paul,&#8221; she called from her dressing table.</p>

			<p>She was seated, in a violet dressing gown, giving the last
			touches to her coiffure, both arms lifted. They were firm and
			white, like her neck and shoulders. She was a handsome
			woman of fifty-five,&#8212;still a woman, not an old person, Wanning
			told himself, as he kissed her cheek. She was heavy in
			figure, to be sure, but she had kept, on the whole, presentable
			outlines. Her complexion was good, and she wore less false
			hair than either of her daughters.</p>

			<p>Wanning himself was five years older, but his sandy hair did
			not show the gray in it, and since his mustache had begun to
			grow white he kept it clipped so short that it was unobtrusive.
			His fresh skin made him look younger than he was. Not
			long ago he had overheard the stenographers in his law office
			discussing the ages of their employers. They had put him
			down at fifty, agreeing that his two partners must be considerably
			older than he&#8212;which was not the case. Wanning had
			an especially kindly feeling for the little new girl, a copyist,
			who had exclaimed that &#8220;Mr. Wanning couldn&#8217;t be fifty; he
			seemed so boyish!&#8221;</p>

			<p><a class="pagenum" id="page183" title="183">&nbsp;</a>Wanning lingered behind his wife, looking at her in the
			mirror.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Well, did you tell the girls, Julia?&#8221; he asked, trying to speak
			casually.</p>

			<p>Mrs. Wanning looked up and met his eyes in the glass.
			&#8220;The girls?&#8221;</p>

			<p>She noticed a strange expression come over his face.</p>

			<p>&#8220;About your health, you mean? Yes, dear, but I tried not to
			alarm them. They feel dreadfully. I&#8217;m going to have a talk
			with Dr. Seares myself. These specialists are all alarmists, and
			I&#8217;ve often heard of his frightening people.&#8221;</p>

			<p>She rose and took her husband&#8217;s arm, drawing him toward
			the fireplace.</p>

			<p>&#8220;You are not going to let this upset you, Paul? If you take
			care of yourself, everything will come out all right. You have
			always been so strong. One has only to look at you.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;Did you,&#8221; Wanning asked, &#8220;say anything to Harold?&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;Yes, of course. I saw him in town today, and he agrees
			with me that Seares draws the worst conclusions possible. He
			says even the young men are always being told the most terrifying
			things. Usually they laugh at the doctors and do as
			they please. You certainly don&#8217;t look like a sick man, and you
			don&#8217;t feel like one, do you?&#8221;</p>

			<p>She patted his shoulder, smiled at him encouragingly, and
			rang for the maid to come and hook her dress.</p>

			<p>When the maid appeared at the door, Wanning went out
			through the bathroom to his own sleeping chamber. He was
			too much dispirited to put on a dinner coat, though such
			remissness was always noticed. He sat down and waited for
			the sound of the gong, leaving his door open, on the chance
			that perhaps one of his daughters would come in.</p>

			<p>When Wanning went down to dinner he found his wife
			already at her chair, and the table laid for four.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Harold,&#8221; she explained, &#8220;is not coming home. He has to
			attend a first night in town.&#8221;</p>

			<p>A moment later their two daughters entered, obviously
			&#8220;dressed.&#8221; They both wore earrings and masses of hair. The
			daughters&#8217; names were Roma and Florence,&#8212;Roma, Firenze,
			one of the young men who came to the house often, but
			<a class="pagenum" id="page184" title="184">&nbsp;</a>not often enough, had called them. Tonight they were going
			to a rehearsal of &#8220;The Dances of the Nations,&#8221;&#8212;a benefit
			performance in which Miss Roma was to lead the Spanish
			dances, her sister the Grecian.</p>

			<p>The elder daughter had often been told that her name
			suited her admirably. She looked, indeed, as we are apt to
			think the unrestrained beauties of later Rome must have
			looked,&#8212;but as their portrait busts emphatically declare they
			did not. Her head was massive, her lips full and crimson,
			her eyes large and heavy-lidded, her forehead low. At costume
			balls and in living pictures she was always Semiramis,
			or Poppea, or Theodora. Barbaric accessories brought out
			something cruel and even rather brutal in her handsome
			face. The men who were attracted to her were somehow
			afraid of her.</p>

			<p>Florence was slender, with a long, graceful neck, a restless
			head, and a flexible mouth&#8212;discontent lurked about the corners
			of it. Her shoulders were pretty, but her neck and arms
			were too thin. Roma was always struggling to keep within a
			certain weight&#8212;her chin and upper arms grew persistently
			more solid&#8212;and Florence was always striving to attain a certain
			weight. Wanning used sometimes to wonder why these
			disconcerting fluctuations could not go the other way; why
			Roma could not melt away as easily as did her sister, who had
			to be sent to Palm Beach to save the precious pounds.</p>

			<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see why you ever put Rickie Allen in charge of the
			English country dances,&#8221; Florence said to her sister, as they
			sat down. &#8220;He knows the figures, of course, but he has no
			real style.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Roma looked annoyed. Rickie Allen was one of the men
			who came to the house almost often enough.</p>

			<p>&#8220;He is absolutely to be depended upon, that&#8217;s why,&#8221; she
			said firmly.</p>

			<p>&#8220;I think he is just right for it, Florence,&#8221; put in Mrs. Wanning.
			&#8220;It&#8217;s remarkable he should feel that he can give up the
			time; such a busy man. He must be very much interested in
			the movement.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Florence&#8217;s lip curled drolly under her soup spoon. She shot
			an amused glance at her mother&#8217;s dignity.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Nothing doing,&#8221; her keen eyes seemed to say.</p>

			<p><a class="pagenum" id="page185" title="185">&nbsp;</a>Though Florence was nearly thirty and her sister a little
			beyond, there was, seriously, nothing doing. With so many
			charms and so much preparation, they never, as Florence vulgarly
			said, quite pulled it off. They had been rushed, time and
			again, and Mrs. Wanning had repeatedly steeled herself to
			bear the blow. But the young men went to follow a career in
			Mexico or the Philippines, or moved to Yonkers, and escaped
			without a mortal wound.</p>

			<p>Roma turned graciously to her father.</p>

			<p>&#8220;I met Mr. Lane at the Holland House today, where I was
			lunching with the Burtons, father. He asked about you, and
			when I told him you were not so well as usual, he said he
			would call you up. He wants to tell you about some doctor he
			discovered in Iowa, who cures everything with massage and
			hot water. It sounds freakish, but Mr. Lane is a very clever
			man, isn&#8217;t he?&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;Very,&#8221; assented Wanning.</p>

			<p>&#8220;I should think he must be!&#8221; sighed Mrs. Wanning. &#8220;How
			in the world did he make all that money, Paul? He didn&#8217;t
			seem especially promising years ago, when we used to see so
			much of them.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;Corporation business. He&#8217;s attorney for the P. L. and G.,&#8221;
			murmured her husband.</p>

			<p>&#8220;What a pile he must have!&#8221; Florence watched the old negro&#8217;s
			slow movements with restless eyes. &#8220;Here is Jenny, a
			Contessa, with a glorious palace in Genoa that her father
			must have bought her. Surely Aldrini had nothing. Have you
			seen the baby count&#8217;s pictures, Roma? They&#8217;re very cunning.
			I should think you&#8217;d go to Genoa and visit Jenny.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;We must arrange that, Roma. It&#8217;s such an opportunity.&#8221;
			Though Mrs. Wanning addressed her daughter, she looked at
			her husband. &#8220;You would get on so well among their friends.
			When Count Aldrini was here you spoke Italian much better
			than poor Jenny. I remember when we entertained him, he
			could scarcely say anything to her at all.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Florence tried to call up an answering flicker of amusement
			upon her sister&#8217;s calm, well-bred face. She thought her
			mother was rather outdoing herself tonight,&#8212;since Aldrini
			had at least managed to say the one important thing to Jenny,
			somehow, somewhere. Jenny Lane had been Roma&#8217;s friend
			<a class="pagenum" id="page186" title="186">&nbsp;</a>and schoolmate, and the Count was an ephemeral hope in
			Orange. Mrs. Wanning was one of the first matrons to declare
			that she had no prejudices against foreigners, and at the dinners
			that were given for the Count, Roma was always put
			next him to act as interpreter.</p>

			<p>Roma again turned to her father.</p>

			<p>&#8220;If I were you, dear, I would let Mr. Lane tell me about his
			doctor. New discoveries are often made by queer people.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Roma&#8217;s voice was low and sympathetic; she never lost her
			dignity.</p>

			<p>Florence asked if she might have her coffee in her room,
			while she dashed off a note, and she ran upstairs humming
			&#8220;Bright Lights&#8221; and wondering how she was going to stand
			her family until the summer scattering. Why could Roma
			never throw off her elegant reserve and call things by their
			names? She sometimes thought she might like her sister, if
			she would only come out in the open and howl about her
			disappointments.</p>

			<p>Roma, drinking her coffee deliberately, asked her father if
			they might have the car early, as they wanted to pick up Mr.
			Allen and Mr. Rydberg on their way to rehearsal.</p>

			<p>Wanning said certainly. Heaven knew he was not stingy
			about his car, though he could never quite forget that in his
			day it was the young men who used to call for the girls when
			they went to rehearsals.</p>

			<p>&#8220;You are going with us, Mother?&#8221; Roma asked as they
			rose.</p>

			<p>&#8220;I think so dear. Your father will want to go to bed early,
			and I shall sleep better if I go out. I am going to town tomorrow
			to pour tea for Harold. We must get him some new
			silver, Paul. I am quite ashamed of his spoons.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Harold, the only son, was a playwright&#8212;as yet &#8220;unproduced&#8221;&#8212;and
			he had a studio in Washington Square.</p>

			<p>A half-hour later, Wanning was alone in his library. He
			would not permit himself to feel aggrieved. What was more
			commendable than a mother&#8217;s interest in her children&#8217;s pleasures?
			Moreover, it was his wife&#8217;s way of following things up,
			of never letting die grass grow under her feet, that had helped
			to push him along in the world. She was more ambitious than
			<a class="pagenum" id="page187" title="187">&nbsp;</a>he,&#8212;that had been good for him. He was naturally indolent,
			and Julia&#8217;s childlike desire to possess material objects, to buy
			what other people were buying, had been the spur that made
			him go after business. It had, moreover, made his house the
			attractive place he believed it to be.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Suppose,&#8221; his wife sometimes said to him when the bills
			came in from Céleste or Mme. Blanche, &#8220;suppose you had
			homely daughters; how would you like that?&#8221;</p>

			<p>He wouldn&#8217;t have liked it. When he went anywhere with
			his three ladies, Wanning always felt very well done by. He
			had no complaint to make about them, or about anything.
			That was why it seemed so unreasonable&#8212;He felt along his
			back incredulously with his hand. Harold, of course, was a
			trial; but among all his business friends, he knew scarcely one
			who had a promising boy.</p>

			<p>The house was so still that Wanning could hear a faint, metallic
			tinkle from the butler&#8217;s pantry. Old Sam was washing
			up the silver, which he put away himself every night.</p>

			<p>Wanning rose and walked aimlessly down the hall and out
			through the dining-room.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Any Apollinaris on ice, Sam? I&#8217;m not feeling very well tonight.&#8221;</p>

			<p>The old colored man dried his hands.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Yessah, Mistah Wanning. Have a little rye with it, sah?&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;No, thank you, Sam. That&#8217;s one of the things I can&#8217;t do
			any more. I&#8217;ve been to see a big doctor in the city, and he tells
			me there&#8217;s something seriously wrong with me. My kidneys
			have sort of gone back on me.&#8221;</p>

			<p>It was a satisfaction to Wanning to name the organ that had
			betrayed him, while all the rest of him was so sound.</p>

			<p>Sam was immediately interested. He shook his grizzled
			head and looked full of wisdom.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t seem like a gen&#8217;leman of such a temperate life ought
			to have anything wrong thar, sah.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;No, it doesn&#8217;t, does it?&#8221;</p>

			<p>Wanning leaned against the china closet and talked to Sam
			for nearly half an hour. The specialist who condemned him
			hadn&#8217;t seemed half so much interested. There was not a detail
			about the examination and the laboratory tests in which Sam
			<a class="pagenum" id="page188" title="188">&nbsp;</a>did not show the deepest concern. He kept asking Wanning if
			he could remember &#8220;straining himself&#8221; when he was a young
			man.</p>

			<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve knowed a strain like that to sleep in a man for yeahs
			and yeahs, and then come back on him, &#8217;deed I have,&#8221; he said,
			mysteriously. &#8220;An&#8217; again, it might be you got a floatin&#8217; kidney,
			sah. Aftah dey once teah loose, dey sometimes don&#8217;t
			make no trouble for quite a while.&#8221;</p>

			<p>When Wanning went to his room he did not go to bed. He
			sat up until he heard the voices of his wife and daughters in
			the hall below. His own bed somehow frightened him. In all
			the years he had lived in this house he had never before
			looked about his room, at that bed, with the thought that he
			might one day be trapped there, and might not get out again.
			He had been ill, of course, but his room had seemed a particularly
			pleasant place for a sick man; sunlight, flowers,&#8212;agreeable,
			well-dressed women coming in and out.</p>

			<p>Now there was something sinister about the bed itself,
			about its position, and its relation to the rest of the furniture.</p>

			<h4>II</h4>

			<p>The next morning, on his way downtown, Wanning got off
			the subway train at Astor Place and walked over to Washington
			Square. He climbed three flights of stairs and knocked at
			his son&#8217;s studio. Harold, dressed, with his stick and gloves in
			his hand, opened the door. He was just going over to the
			Brevoort for breakfast. He greeted his father with the cordial
			familiarity practised by all the &#8220;boys&#8221; of his set, clapped him
			on the shoulder and said in his light, tonsilitis voice:</p>

			<p>&#8220;Come in, Governor, how delightful! I haven&#8217;t had a call
			from you in a long time.&#8221;</p>

			<p>He threw his hat and gloves on the writing table. He was a
			perfect gentleman, even with his father.</p>

			<p>Florence said the matter with Harold was that he had heard
			people say he looked like Byron, and stood for it.</p>

			<p>What Harold would stand for in such matters was, indeed,
			the best definition of him. When he read his play &#8220;The Street
			Walker&#8221; in drawing rooms and one lady told him it had the
			poetic symbolism of Tchekhov, and another said that it suggested
			<a class="pagenum" id="page189" title="189">&nbsp;</a>the biting realism of Brieux, he never, in his most secret
			thoughts, questioned the acumen of either lady. Harold&#8217;s
			speech, even if you heard it in the next room and could not
			see him, told you that he had no sense of the absurd,&#8212;a
			throaty staccato, with never a downward inflection, trustfully
			striving to please.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Just going out?&#8221; his father asked. &#8220;I won&#8217;t keep you. Your
			mother told you I had a discouraging session with Seares?&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;So awfully sorry you&#8217;ve had this bother, Governor; just as
			sorry as I can be. No question about it&#8217;s coming out all right,
			but it&#8217;s a downright nuisance, your having to diet and that
			sort of thing. And I suppose you ought to follow directions,
			just to make us all feel comfortable, oughtn&#8217;t you?&#8221; Harold
			spoke with fluent sympathy.</p>

			<p>Wanning sat down on the arm of a chair and shook his
			head. &#8220;Yes, they do recommend a diet, but they don&#8217;t promise
			much from it.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Harold laughed precipitately. &#8220;Delicious! All doctors are,
			aren&#8217;t they? So profound and oracular! The medicine-man;
			it&#8217;s quite the same idea, you see; with tom-toms.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Wanning knew that Harold meant something subtle,&#8212;one
			of the subtleties which he said were only spoiled by being
			explained&#8212;so he came bluntly to one of the issues he had in
			mind.</p>

			<p>&#8220;I would like to see you settled before I quit the harness,
			Harold.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Harold was absolutely tolerant.</p>

			<p>He took out his cigarette case and burnished it with his
			handkerchief.</p>

			<p>&#8220;I perfectly understand your point of view, dear Governor,
			but perhaps you don&#8217;t altogether get mine. Isn&#8217;t it so? I am
			settled. What you mean by being settled, would unsettle me,
			completely. I&#8217;m cut out for just such an existence as this; to
			live four floors up in an attic, get my own breakfast, and have
			a charwoman to do for me. I should be awfully bored with an
			establishment. I&#8217;m quite content with a little diggings like
			this.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Wanning&#8217;s eyes fell. Somebody had to pay the rent of even
			such modest quarters as contented Harold, but to say so
			would be rude, and Harold himself was never rude. Wanning
			<a class="pagenum" id="page190" title="190">&nbsp;</a>did not, this morning, feel equal to hearing a statement of his
			son&#8217;s uncommercial ideals.</p>

			<p>&#8220;I know,&#8221; he said hastily. &#8220;But now we&#8217;re up against hard
			facts, my boy. I did not want to alarm your mother, but I&#8217;ve
			had a time limit put on me, and it&#8217;s not a very long one.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Harold threw away the cigarette he had just lighted in a
			burst of indignation.</p>

			<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the sort of thing I consider criminal, Father, absolutely
			criminal! What doctor has a right to suggest such a
			thing? Seares himself may be knocked out tomorrow. What
			have laboratory tests got to do with a man&#8217;s will to live? The
			force of that depends upon his entire personality, not on any
			organ or pair of organs.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Harold thrust his hands in his pockets and walked up and
			down, very much stirred. &#8220;Really, I have a very poor opinion
			of scientists. They ought to be made serve an apprenticeship
			in art, to get some conception of the power of human motives.
			Such brutality!&#8221;</p>

			<p>Harold&#8217;s plays dealt with the grimmest and most depressing
			matters, but he himself was always agreeable, and he insisted
			upon high cheerfulness as the correct tone of human
			intercourse.</p>

			<p>Wanning rose and turned to go. There was, in Harold, simply
			no reality, to which one could break through. The young
			man took up his hat and gloves.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Must you go? Let me step along with you to the sub. The
			walk will do me good.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Harold talked agreeably all the way to Astor Place. His
			father heard little of what he said, but he rather liked his
			company and his wish to be pleasant.</p>

			<p>Wanning went to his club for luncheon, meaning to spend
			the afternoon with some of his friends who had retired from
			business and who read the papers there in the empty hours
			between two and seven. He got no satisfaction, however.
			When he tried to tell these men of his present predicament,
			they began to describe ills of their own in which he could not
			feel interested. Each one of them had a treacherous organ of
			which he spoke with animation, almost with pride, as if it
			were a crafty business competitor whom he was constantly
			<a class="pagenum" id="page191" title="191">&nbsp;</a>outwitting. Each had a doctor, too, for whom he was ardently
			soliciting business. They wanted either to telephone
			their doctor and make an appointment for Wanning, or to
			take him then and there to the consulting room. When he did
			not accept these invitations, they lost interest in him and remembered
			engagements. He called a taxi and returned to the
			offices of McQuiston, Wade, and Wanning.</p>

			<p>Settled at his desk, Wanning decided that he would not
			go home to dinner, but would stay at the office and dictate
			a long letter to an old college friend who lived in Wyoming.
			He could tell Douglas Brown things that he had not
			succeeded in getting to any one else. Brown, out in the
			Wind River mountains, couldn&#8217;t defend himself, couldn&#8217;t
			slap Wanning on the back and tell him to gather up the sunbeams.</p>

			<p>He called up his house in Orange to say that he would not
			be home until late. Roma answered the telephone. He spoke
			mournfully, but she was not disturbed by it.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Very well, Father. Don&#8217;t get too tired,&#8221; she said in her well
			modulated voice.</p>

			<p>When Wanning was ready to dictate his letter, he looked
			out from his private office into the reception room and saw
			that his stenographer in her hat and gloves, and furs of the
			newest cut, was just leaving.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Goodnight, Mr. Wanning,&#8221; she said, drawing down her
			dotted veil.</p>

			<p>Had there been important business letters to be got off on
			the night mail, he would have felt that he could detain her,
			but not for anything personal. Miss Doane was an expert
			legal stenographer, and she knew her value. The slightest
			delay in dispatching office business annoyed her. Letters that
			were not signed until the next morning awoke her deepest
			contempt. She was scrupulous in professional etiquette, and
			Wanning felt that their relations, though pleasant, were
			scarcely cordial.</p>

			<p>As Miss Doane&#8217;s trim figure disappeared through the outer
			door, little Annie Wooley, the copyist, came in from the stenographers&#8217;
			room. Her hat was pinned over one ear, and she
			was scrambling into her coat as she came, holding her gloves
			<a class="pagenum" id="page192" title="192">&nbsp;</a>in her teeth and her battered handbag in the fist that was
			already through a sleeve.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Annie, I wanted to dictate a letter. You were just leaving,
			weren&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t mind!&#8221; she answered cheerfully, and pulling
			off her old coat, threw it on a chair. &#8220;I&#8217;ll get my book.&#8221;</p>

			<p>She followed him into his room and sat down by a table,&#8212;though
			she wrote with her book on her knee.</p>

			<p>Wanning had several times kept her after office hours to
			take his private letters for him, and she had always been good-natured
			about it. On each occasion, when he gave her a dollar
			to get her dinner, she protested, laughing, and saying that she
			could never eat so much as that.</p>

			<p>She seemed a happy sort of little creature, didn&#8217;t pout when
			she was scolded, and giggled about her own mistakes in spelling.
			She was plump and undersized, always dodging under
			the elbows of taller people and clattering about on high heels,
			much run over. She had bright black eyes and fuzzy black hair
			in which, despite Miss Doane&#8217;s reprimands, she often stuck
			her pencil. She was the girl who couldn&#8217;t believe that Wanning
			was fifty, and he had liked her ever since he overheard
			that conversation.</p>

			<p>Tilting back his chair&#8212;he never assumed this position
			when he dictated to Miss Doane&#8212;Wanning began: &#8220;To Mr.
			D. E. Brown, South Forks, Wyoming.&#8221;</p>

			<p>He shaded his eyes with his hand and talked off a long
			letter to this man who would be sorry that his mortal frame
			was breaking up. He recalled to him certain fine months they
			had spent together on the Wind River when they were young
			men, and said he sometimes wished that like D. E. Brown, he
			had claimed his freedom in a big country where the wheels
			did not grind a man as hard as they did in New York. He had
			spent all these years hustling about and getting ready to live
			the way he wanted to live, and now he had a puncture the
			doctors couldn&#8217;t mend. What was the use of it?</p>

			<p>Wanning&#8217;s thoughts were fixed on the trout streams and
			the great silver-firs in the canyons of the Wind River Mountains,
			when he was disturbed by a soft, repeated sniffling. He
			looked out between his fingers. Little Annie, carried away by
			his eloquence, was fairly panting to make dots and dashes fast
			<a class="pagenum" id="page193" title="193">&nbsp;</a>enough, and she was sopping her eyes with an unpresentable,
			end-of-the-day handkerchief.</p>

			<p>Wanning rambled on in his dictation. Why was she crying?
			What did it matter to her? He was a man who said good-morning
			to her, who sometimes took an hour of the precious
			few she had left at the end of the day and then complained
			about her bad spelling. When the letter was finished, he
			handed her a new two dollar bill.</p>

			<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t got any change tonight; and anyhow, I&#8217;d like
			you to eat a whole lot. I&#8217;m on a diet, and I want to see everybody
			else eat.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Annie tucked her notebook under her arm and stood looking
			at the bill which she had not taken up from the table.</p>

			<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t like to be paid for taking letters to your friends,
			Mr. Wanning,&#8221; she said impulsively. &#8220;I can run personal letters
			off between times. It ain&#8217;t as if I needed the money,&#8221; she
			added carelessly.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Get along with you! Anybody who is eighteen years old
			and has a sweet tooth needs money, all they can get.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Annie giggled and darted out with the bill in her hand.</p>

			<p>Wanning strolled aimlessly after her into the reception
			room.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Let me have that letter before lunch tomorrow, please,
			and be sure that nobody sees it.&#8221; He stopped and frowned. &#8220;I
			don&#8217;t look very sick, do I?&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;I should say you don&#8217;t!&#8221; Annie got her coat on after considerable
			tugging. &#8220;Why don&#8217;t you call in a specialist? My
			mother called a specialist for my father before he died.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;Oh, is your father dead?&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;I should say he is! He was a painter by trade, and he fell
			off a seventy-foot stack into the East River. Mother couldn&#8217;t
			get anything out of the company, because he wasn&#8217;t buckled.
			He lingered for four months, so I know all about taking care
			of sick people. I was attending business college then, and sick
			as he was, he used to give me dictation for practise. He made
			us all go into professions; the girls, too. He didn&#8217;t like us to
			just run.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Wanning would have liked to keep Annie and hear more
			about her family, but it was nearly seven o&#8217;clock, and he knew
			he ought, in mercy, to let her go. She was the only person to
			<a class="pagenum" id="page194" title="194">&nbsp;</a>whom he had talked about his illness who had been frank and
			honest with him, who had looked at him with eyes that concealed
			nothing. When he broke the news of his condition to
			his partners that morning, they shut him off as if he were
			uttering indecent ravings. All day they had met him with a
			hurried, abstracted manner. McQuiston and Wade went out
			to lunch together, and he knew what they were thinking, perhaps
			talking, about. Wanning had brought into the firm valuable
			business, but he was less enterprising than either of his
			partners.</p>

			<h4>III</h4>

			<p>In the early summer Wanning&#8217;s family scattered. Roma
			swallowed her pride and sailed for Genoa to visit the Contessa
			Jenny. Harold went to Cornish to be in an artistic atmosphere.
			Mrs. Wanning and Florence took a cottage at York
			Harbor where Wanning was supposed to join them whenever
			he could get away from town. He did not often get away. He
			felt most at ease among his accustomed surroundings. He
			kept his car in the city and went back and forth from his office
			to the club where he was living. Old Sam, his butler, came in
			from Orange every night to put his clothes in order and make
			him comfortable.</p>

			<p>Wanning began to feel that he would not tire of his office in
			a hundred years. Although he did very little work, it was
			pleasant to go down town every morning when the streets
			were crowded, the sky clear, and the sunshine bright. From
			the windows of his private office he could see the harbor and
			watch the ocean liners come down the North River and go
			out to sea.</p>

			<p>While he read his mail, he often looked out and wondered
			why he had been so long indifferent to that extraordinary
			scene of human activity and hopefulness. How had a short-lived
			race of beings the energy and courage valiantly to begin
			enterprises which they could follow for only a few years; to
			throw up towers and build sea-monsters and found great
			businesses, when the frailest of the materials with which they
			worked, the paper upon which they wrote, the ink upon their
			pens, had more permanence in this world than they? All this
			<a class="pagenum" id="page195" title="195">&nbsp;</a>material rubbish lasted. The linen clothing and cosmetics of
			the Egyptians had lasted. It was only the human flame that
			certainly, certainly went out. Other things had a fighting
			chance; they might meet with mishap and be destroyed, they
			might not. But the human creature who gathered and shaped
			and hoarded and foolishly loved these things, he had no
			chance&#8212;absolutely none. Wanning&#8217;s cane, his hat, his topcoat,
			might go from beggar to beggar and knock about in this
			world for another fifty years or so; but not he.</p>

			<p>In the late afternoon he never hurried to leave his office
			now. Wonderful sunsets burned over the North River, wonderful
			stars trembled up among the towers; more wonderful
			than anything he could hurry away to. One of his windows
			looked directly down upon the spire of Old Trinity, with the
			green churchyard and the pale sycamores far below. Wanning
			often dropped into the church when he was going out to
			lunch; not because he was trying to make his peace with
			Heaven, but because the church was old and restful and familiar,
			because it and its gravestones had sat in the same place for
			a long while. He bought flowers from the street boys and
			kept them on his desk, which his partners thought strange
			behavior, and which Miss Doane considered a sign that he
			was failing.</p>

			<p>But there were graver things than bouquets for Miss Doane
			and the senior partner to ponder over.</p>

			<p>The senior partner, McQuiston, in spite of his silvery hair
			and mustache and his important church connections, had rich
			natural taste for scandal.&#8212;After Mr. Wade went away for his
			vacation, in May, Wanning took Annie Wooley out of the
			copying room, put her at a desk in his private office, and
			raised her pay to eighteen dollars a week, explaining to McQuiston
			that for the summer months he would need a secretary.
			This explanation satisfied neither McQuiston nor Miss
			Doane.</p>

			<p>Annie was also paid for overtime, and although Wanning
			attended to very little of the office business now, there was a
			great deal of overtime. Miss Doane was, of course, &#8216;above&#8217;
			questioning a chit like Annie; but what was he doing with his
			time and his new secretary, she wanted to know?</p>

			<p>If anyone had told her that Wanning was writing a book,
			<a class="pagenum" id="page196" title="196">&nbsp;</a>she would have said bitterly that it was just like him. In his
			youth Wanning had hankered for the pen. When he studied
			law, he had intended to combine that profession with some
			tempting form of authorship. Had he remained a bachelor, he
			would have been an unenterprising literary lawyer to the end
			of his days. It was his wife&#8217;s restlessness and her practical turn
			of mind that had made him a money-getter. His illness
			seemed to bring back to him the illusions with which he left
			college.</p>

			<p>As soon as his family were out of the way and he shut up
			the Orange house, he began to dictate his autobiography to
			Annie Wooley. It was not only the story of his life, but an
			expression of all his theories and opinions, and a commentary
			on the fifty years of events which he could remember.</p>

			<p>Fortunately, he was able to take great interest in this undertaking.
			He had the happiest convictions about the clear-cut
			style he was developing and his increasing felicity in phrasing.
			He meant to publish the work handsomely, at his own expense
			and under his own name. He rather enjoyed the
			thought of how greatly disturbed Harold would be. He and
			Harold differed in their estimates of books. All the solid
			works which made up Wanning&#8217;s library, Harold considered
			beneath contempt. Anybody, he said, could do that sort of
			thing.</p>

			<p>When Wanning could not sleep at night, he turned on the
			light beside his bed and made notes on the chapter he meant
			to dictate the next day.</p>

			<p>When he returned to the office after lunch, he gave instructions
			that he was not to be interrupted by telephone calls, and
			shut himself up with his secretary.</p>

			<p>After he had opened all the windows and taken off his coat,
			he fell to dictating. He found it a delightful occupation, the
			solace of each day. Often he had sudden fits of tiredness; then
			he would lie down on the leather sofa and drop asleep, while
			Annie read &#8220;The Leopard&#8217;s Spots&#8221; until he awoke.</p>

			<p>Like many another business man Wanning had relied so
			long on stenographers that the operation of writing with a
			pen had become laborious to him. When he undertook it, he
			wanted to cut everything short. But walking up and down his
			private office, with the strong afternoon sun pouring in at his
			<a class="pagenum" id="page197" title="197">&nbsp;</a>windows, a fresh air stirring, all the people and boats moving
			restlessly down there, he could say things he wanted to say. It
			was like living his life over again.</p>

			<p>He did not miss his wife or his daughters. He had become
			again the mild, contemplative youth he was in college, before
			he had a profession and a family to grind for, before the two
			needs which shape our destiny had made of him pretty much
			what they make of every man.</p>

			<p>At five o&#8217;clock Wanning sometimes went out for a cup of
			tea and took Annie along. He felt dull and discouraged as
			soon as he was alone. So long as Annie was with him, he
			could keep a grip on his own thoughts. They talked about
			what he had just been dictating to her. She found that he
			liked to be questioned, and she tried to be greatly interested
			in it all.</p>

			<p>After tea, they went back to the office. Occasionally Wanning
			lost track of time and kept Annie until it grew dark. He
			knew he had old McQuiston guessing, but he didn&#8217;t care.
			One day the senior partner came to him with a reproving air.</p>

			<p>&#8220;I am afraid Miss Doane is leaving us, Paul. She feels that
			Miss Wooley&#8217;s promotion is irregular.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;How is that any business of hers, I&#8217;d like to know? She has
			all my legal work. She is always disagreeable enough about
			doing anything else.&#8221;</p>

			<p>McQuiston&#8217;s puffy red face went a shade darker.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Miss Doane has a certain professional pride; a strong feeling
			for office organization. She doesn&#8217;t care to fill an equivocal
			position. I don&#8217;t know that I blame her. She feels that
			there is something not quite regular about the confidence you
			seem to place in this inexperienced young woman.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Wanning pushed back his chair.</p>

			<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t care a hang about Miss Doane&#8217;s sense of propriety.
			I need a stenographer who will carry out my instructions. I&#8217;ve
			carried out Miss Doane&#8217;s long enough. I&#8217;ve let that schoolma&#8217;am
			hector me for years. She can go when she pleases.&#8221;</p>

			<p>That night McQuiston wrote to his partner that things
			were in a bad way, and they would have to keep an eye on
			Wanning. He had been seen at the theatre with his new
			stenographer.</p>

			<p>That was true. Wanning had several times taken Annie to
			<a class="pagenum" id="page198" title="198">&nbsp;</a>the Palace on Saturday afternoon. When all his acquaintances
			were off motoring or playing golf, when the down-town offices
			and even the streets were deserted, it amused him to
			watch a foolish show with a delighted, cheerful little person
			beside him.</p>

			<p>Beyond her generosity, Annie had no shining merits of
			character, but she had the gift of thinking well of everything,
			and wishing well. When she was there Wanning felt as if there
			were someone who cared whether this was a good or a bad
			day with him. Old Sam, too, was like that. While the old
			black man put him to bed and made him comfortable, Wanning
			could talk to him as he talked to little Annie. Even if he
			dwelt upon his illness, in plain terms, in detail, he did not feel
			as if he were imposing on them.</p>

			<p>People like Sam and Annie admitted misfortune,&#8212;admitted
			it almost cheerfully. Annie and her family did not consider
			illness or any of its hard facts vulgar or indecent. It had its
			place in their scheme of life, as it had not in that of Wanning&#8217;s
			friends.</p>

			<p>Annie came out of a typical poor family of New York. Of
			eight children, only four lived to grow up. In such families
			the stream of life is broad enough, but runs shallow. In the
			children, vitality is exhausted early. The roots do not go down
			into anything very strong. Illness and deaths and funerals, in
			her own family and in those of her friends, had come at frequent
			intervals in Annie&#8217;s life. Since they had to be, she and
			her sisters made the best of them. There was something to be
			got out of funerals, even, if they were managed right. They
			kept people in touch with old friends who had moved uptown,
			and revived kindly feelings.</p>

			<p>Annie had often given up things she wanted because there
			was sickness at home, and now she was patient with her boss.
			What he paid her for overtime work by no means made up to
			her what she lost.</p>

			<p>Annie was not in the least thrifty, nor were any of her
			sisters. She had to make a living, but she was not interested
			in getting all she could for her time, or in laying up for
			the future. Girls like Annie know that the future is a very uncertain
			thing, and they feel no responsibility about it. The
			present is what they have&#8212;and it is all they have. If Annie
			<a class="pagenum" id="page199" title="199">&nbsp;</a>missed a chance to go sailing with the plumber&#8217;s son on Saturday
			afternoon, why, she missed it. As for the two dollars
			her boss gave her, she handed them over to her mother. Now
			that Annie was getting more money, one of her sisters quit a
			job she didn&#8217;t like and was staying at home for a rest. That
			was all promotion meant to Annie.</p>

			<p>The first time Annie&#8217;s boss asked her to work on Saturday
			afternoon, she could not hide her disappointment. He suggested
			that they might knock off early and go to a show, or
			take a run in his car, but she grew tearful and said it would be
			hard to make her family understand. Wanning thought perhaps
			he could explain to her mother. He called his motor and
			took Annie home.</p>

			<p>When his car stopped in front of the tenement house on
			Eighth Avenue, heads came popping out of the windows for
			six storys up, and all the neighbor women, in dressing sacks
			and wrappers, gazed down at the machine and at the couple
			alighting from it. A motor meant a wedding or the hospital.</p>

			<p>The plumber&#8217;s son, Willy Steen, came over from the corner
			saloon to see what was going on, and Annie introduced him
			at the doorstep.</p>

			<p>Mrs. Wooley asked Wanning to come into the parlor and
			invited him to have a chair of ceremony between the folding
			bed and the piano.</p>

			<p>Annie, nervous and tearful, escaped to the dining-room&#8212;the
			cheerful spot where the daughters visited with each other
			and with their friends. The parlor was a masked sleeping
			chamber and store room.</p>

			<p>The plumber&#8217;s son sat down on the sofa beside Mrs.
			Wooley, as if he were accustomed to share in the family councils.
			Mrs. Wooley waited expectant and kindly. She looked the
			sensible, hard-working woman that she was, and one could
			see she hadn&#8217;t lived all her life on Eighth Avenue without
			learning a great deal.</p>

			<p>Wanning explained to her that he was writing a book which
			he wanted to finish during the summer months when business
			was not so heavy. He was ill and could not work regularly.
			His secretary would have to take his dictation when he felt
			able to give it; must, in short, be a sort of companion to him.
			He would like to feel that she could go out in his car with
			<a class="pagenum" id="page200" title="200">&nbsp;</a>him, or even to the theater, when he felt like it. It might have
			been better if he had engaged a young man for this work, but
			since he had begun it with Annie, he would like to keep her if
			her mother was willing.</p>

			<p>Mrs. Wooley watched him with friendly, searching eyes.
			She glanced at Willy Steen, who, wise in such distinctions,
			had decided that there was nothing shady about Annie&#8217;s boss.
			He nodded his sanction.</p>

			<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want my girl to conduct herself in any such way as
			will prejudice her, Mr. Wanning,&#8221; she said thoughtfully. &#8220;If
			you&#8217;ve got daughters, you know how that is. You&#8217;ve been liberal
			with Annie, and it&#8217;s a good position for her. It&#8217;s right
			she should go to business every day, and I want her to do her
			work right, but I like to have her home after working hours. I
			always think a young girl&#8217;s time is her own after business
			hours, and I try not to burden them when they come home.
			I&#8217;m willing she should do your work as suits you, if it&#8217;s her
			wish; but I don&#8217;t like to press her. The good times she misses
			now, it&#8217;s not you nor me, sir, that can make them up to her.
			These young things has their feelings.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t want to press her, either,&#8221; Wanning said hastily.
			&#8220;I simply want to know that you understand the situation.
			I&#8217;ve made her a little present in my will as a recognition that
			she is doing more for me than she is paid for.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s something above me, sir. We&#8217;ll hope there won&#8217;t be
			no question of wills for many years yet,&#8221; Mrs. Wooley spoke
			heartily. &#8220;I&#8217;m glad if my girl can be of any use to you, just so
			she don&#8217;t prejudice herself.&#8221;</p>

			<p>The plumber&#8217;s son rose as if the interview were over.</p>

			<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all right, Mama Wooley, don&#8217;t you worry,&#8221; he said.</p>

			<p>He picked up his canvas cap and turned to Wanning. &#8220;You
			see, Annie ain&#8217;t the sort of girl that would want to be spotted
			circulating around with a monied party her folks didn&#8217;t know
			all about. She&#8217;d lose friends by it.&#8221;</p>

			<p>After this conversation Annie felt a great deal happier. She
			was still shy and a trifle awkward with poor Wanning when
			they were outside the office building, and she missed the old
			freedom of her Saturday afternoons. But she did the best she
			could, and Willy Steen tried to make it up to her.</p>

			<p>In Annie&#8217;s absence he often came in of an afternoon to have
			<a class="pagenum" id="page201" title="201">&nbsp;</a>a cup of tea and a sugar-bun with Mrs. Wooley and the
			daughter who was &#8220;resting.&#8221; As they sat at the dining-room
			table, they discussed Annie&#8217;s employer, his peculiarities, his
			health, and what he had told Mrs. Wooley about his will.</p>

			<p>Mrs. Wooley said she sometimes felt afraid he might disinherit
			his children, as rich people often did, and make talk; but
			she hoped for the best. Whatever came to Annie, she prayed
			it might not be in the form of taxable property.</p>

			<h4>IV</h4>

			<p>Late in September Wanning grew suddenly worse. His
			family hurried home, and he was put to bed in his house
			in Orange. He kept asking the doctors when he could get
			back to the office, but he lived only eight days.</p>

			<p>The morning after his father&#8217;s funeral, Harold went to the
			office to consult Wanning&#8217;s partners and to read the will.
			Everything in the will was as it should be. There were no
			surprises except a codicil in the form of a letter to Mrs. Wanning,
			dated July 8th, requesting that out of the estate she
			should pay the sum of one thousand dollars to his stenographer,
			Annie Wooley, &#8220;in recognition of her faithful services.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;I thought Miss Doane was my father&#8217;s stenographer,&#8221;
			Harold exclaimed.</p>

			<p>Alec McQuiston looked embarrassed and spoke in a low,
			guarded tone.</p>

			<p>&#8220;She was, for years. But this spring,&#8212;&#8221; he hesitated.</p>

			<p>McQuiston loved a scandal. He leaned across his desk toward
			Harold.</p>

			<p>&#8220;This spring your father put this little girl, Miss Wooley, a
			copyist, utterly inexperienced, in Miss Doane&#8217;s place. Miss
			Doane was indignant and left us. The change made comment
			here in the office. It was slightly&#8212;No, I will be frank with
			you, Harold, it was very irregular.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Harold also looked grave. &#8220;What could my father have
			meant by such a request as this to my mother?&#8221;</p>

			<p>The silver haired senior partner flushed and spoke as if he
			were trying to break something gently.</p>

			<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t understand it, my boy. But I think, indeed I prefer
			to think, that your father was not quite himself all this
			<a class="pagenum" id="page202" title="202">&nbsp;</a>summer. A man like your father does not, in his right senses,
			find pleasure in the society of an ignorant, common little girl.
			He does not make a practise of keeping her at the office after
			hours, often until eight o&#8217;clock, or take her to restaurants and
			to the theater with him; not, at least, in a slanderous city like
			New York.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Harold flinched before McQuiston&#8217;s meaning gaze and
			turned aside in pained silence. He knew, as a dramatist, that
			there are dark chapters in all men&#8217;s lives, and this but too
			clearly explained why his father had stayed in town all summer
			instead of joining his family.</p>

			<p>McQuiston asked if he should ring for Annie Wooley.</p>

			<p>Harold drew himself up. &#8220;No. Why should I see her? I
			prefer not to. But with your permission, Mr. McQuiston, I
			will take charge of this request to my mother. It could only
			give her pain, and might awaken doubts in her mind.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;We hardly know,&#8221; murmured the senior partner, &#8220;where
			an investigation would lead us. Technically, of course, I cannot
			agree with you. But if, as one of the executors of the will,
			you wish to assume personal responsibility for this bequest,
			under the circumstances&#8212;irregularities beget irregularities.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;My first duty to my father,&#8221; said Harold, &#8220;is to protect my
			mother.&#8221;</p>

			<p>That afternoon McQuiston called Annie Wooley into his
			private office and told her that her services would not be
			needed any longer, and that in lieu of notice the clerk would
			give her two weeks&#8217; salary.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Can I call up here for references?&#8221; Annie asked.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Certainly. But you had better ask for me, personally. You
			must know there has been some criticism of you here in the
			office, Miss Wooley.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;What about?&#8221; Annie asked boldly.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Well, a young girl like you cannot render so much personal
			service to her employer as you did to Mr. Wanning
			without causing unfavorable comment. To be blunt with you,
			for your own good, my dear young lady, your services to
			your employer should terminate in the office, and at the close
			of office hours. Mr. Wanning was a very sick man and his
			judgment was at fault, but you should have known what a girl
			in your station can do and what she cannot do.&#8221;</p>

			<p><a class="pagenum" id="page203" title="203">&nbsp;</a>The vague discomfort of months flashed up in little Annie.
			She had no mind to stand by and be lectured without having
			a word to say for herself.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Of course he was sick, poor man!&#8221; she burst out. &#8220;Not as
			anybody seemed much upset about it. I wouldn&#8217;t have given
			up my half-holidays for anybody if they hadn&#8217;t been sick, no
			matter what they paid me. There wasn&#8217;t anything in it for
			me.&#8221;</p>

			<p>McQuiston raised his hand warningly.</p>

			<p>&#8220;That will do, young lady. But when you get another
			place, remember this: it is never your duty to entertain or to
			provide amusement for your employer.&#8221;</p>

			<p>He gave Annie a look which she did not clearly understand,
			although she pronounced him a nasty old man as she hustled
			on her hat and jacket.</p>

			<p>When Annie reached home she found Willy Steen sitting
			with her mother and sister at the dining-room table. This was
			the first day that Annie had gone to the office since Wanning&#8217;s
			death, and her family awaited her return with suspense.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Hello yourself,&#8221; Annie called as she came in and threw her
			handbag into an empty armchair.</p>

			<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re off early, Annie,&#8221; said her mother gravely. &#8220;Has the
			will been read?&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;I guess so. Yes, I know it has. Miss Wilson got it out of
			the safe for them. The son came in. He&#8217;s a pill.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;Was nothing said to you, daughter?&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;Yes, a lot. Please give me some tea, mother.&#8221; Annie felt
			that her swagger was failing.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t tantalize us, Ann,&#8221; her sister broke in. &#8220;Didn&#8217;t you
			get anything?&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;I got the mit, all right. And some back talk from the old
			man that I&#8217;m awful sore about.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Annie dashed away the tears and gulped her tea.</p>

			<p>Gradually her mother and Willy drew the story from her.
			Willy offered at once to go to the office building and take his
			stand outside the door and never leave it until he had
			punched old Mr. McQuiston&#8217;s face. He rose as if to attend to
			it at once, but Mrs. Wooley drew him to his chair again and
			patted his arm.</p>

			<p>&#8220;It would only start talk and get the girl in trouble, Willy.
			<a class="pagenum" id="page204" title="204">&nbsp;</a>When it&#8217;s lawyers, folks in our station is helpless. I certainly
			believed that man when he sat here; you heard him yourself.
			Such a gentleman as he looked.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Willy thumped his great fist, still in punching position,
			down on his knee.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Never you be fooled again, Mama Wooley. You&#8217;ll never
			get anything out of a rich guy that he ain&#8217;t signed up in the
			courts for. Rich is tight. There&#8217;s no exceptions.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Annie shook her head.</p>

			<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t want anything out of him. He was a nice, kind
			man, and he had his troubles, I guess. He wasn&#8217;t tight.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;Still,&#8221; said Mrs. Wooley sadly, &#8220;Mr. Wanning had no call
			to hold out promises. I hate to be disappointed in a gentleman.
			You&#8217;ve had confining work for some time, daughter; a
			rest will do you good.&#8221;</p>

			<h3 class="essay_title">Mark Twain <a class="return_toc" href="#contents" title="Return to Contents">ToC</a></h3>
			<div id="twain_1" class="review">
				<p class="first_paragraph">If there is anything which should make an American sick
				and disgusted at the literary taste of his country, and almost
				swerve his allegiance to his flag it is that controversy
				between Mark Twain and Max O&#8217;Rell, in which the Frenchman
				proves himself a wit and a gentleman and the American
				shows himself little short of a clown and an all around tough.
				The squabble arose apropos of Paul Bourget&#8217;s new book on
				America, &#8220;Outre Mer,&#8221; a book which deals more fairly and
				generously with this country than any book yet written in a
				foreign tongue. Mr. Clemens did not like the book, and like
				all men of his class, and limited mentality, he cannot criticise
				without becoming personal and insulting. He cannot be
				scathing without being a blackguard. He tried to demolish a
				serious and well considered work by publishing a scurrilous,
				slangy and loosely written article about it. In this article Mr.
				Clemens proves very little against Mr. Bourget and a very
				great deal against himself. He demonstrates clearly that he is
				neither a scholar, a reader or a man of letters and very little of
				a gentleman. His ignorance of French literature is something
				appalling. Why, in these days it is as necessary for a literary
				man to have a wide knowledge of the French masterpieces as
				it is for him to have read Shakespeare or the Bible. What man
				who pretends to be an author can afford to neglect those
				models of style and composition. George Meredith, Thomas
				Hardy and Henry James excepted, the great living novelists
				are Frenchmen.</p>

				<p>Mr. Clemens asks what the French sensualists can possibly
				teach the great American people about novel writing or morality?
				Well, it would not seriously hurt the art of the classic
				author of &#8220;Puddin&#8217; Head Wilson&#8221; to study Daudet, De Maupassant,
				Hugo and George Sand, whatever it might do to his
				morals. Mark Twain is a humorist of a kind. His humor is
				always rather broad, so broad that the polite world can justly
				call it coarse. He is not a reader nor a thinker nor a man who
				loves art of any kind. He is a clever Yankee who has made a
				&#8220;good thing&#8221; out of writing. He has been published in the
				<a class="pagenum" id="page208" title="208">&nbsp;</a>North American Review and in the Century, but he is not
				and never will be a part of literature. The association and
				companionship of cultured men has given Mark Twain a sort
				of professional veneer, but it could not give him fine instincts
				or nice discriminations or elevated tastes. His works are pure
				and suitable for children, just as the work of most shallow and
				mediocre fellows. House dogs and donkeys make the most
				harmless and chaste companions for young innocence in the
				world. Mark Twain&#8217;s humor is of the kind that teamsters use
				in bantering with each other, and his laugh is the gruff &#8220;haw-haw&#8221;
				of the backwoodsman. He is still the rough, awkward,
				good-natured boy who swore at the deck hands on the river
				steamer and chewed uncured tobacco when he was three years
				old. Thoroughly likeable as a good fellow, but impossible as a
				man of letters. It is an unfortunate feature of American literature
				that a hostler with some natural cleverness and a great
				deal of assertion receives the same recognition as a standard
				American author that a man like Lowell does. The French
				academy is a good thing after all. It at least divides the sheep
				from the goats and gives a sheep the consolation of knowing
				that he is a sheep.</p>

				<p>It is rather a pity that Paul Bourget should have written
				&#8220;Outre Mer,&#8221; thoroughly creditable book though it is. Mr.
				Bourget is a novelist, and he should not content himself with
				being an essayist, there are far too many of them in the world
				already. He can develop strong characters, invent strong situations,
				he can write the truth and he should not drift into
				penning opinions and platitudes. When God has made a man
				a creator, it is a great mistake for him to turn critic. It is
				rather an insult to God and certainly a very great wrong to
				man.</p>

			<div id="twain_2" class="review">
				<p>I got a letter last week from a little boy just half-past seven
				who had just read &#8220;Huckleberry Finn&#8221; and &#8220;Tom Sawyer.&#8221;
				He said: &#8220;If there are any more books like them in the world,
				send them to me quick.&#8221; I had to humbly confess to him that
				<a class="pagenum" id="page209" title="209">&nbsp;</a>if there were any others I had not the good fortune to know
				of them. What a red-letter-day it is to a boy, the day he first
				opens &#8220;Tom Sawyer.&#8221; I would rather sail on the raft down the
				Missouri again with &#8220;Huck&#8221; Finn and Jim than go down the
				Nile in December or see Venice from a gondola in May. Certainly
				Mark Twain is much better when he writes of his Missouri
				boys than when he makes sickley romances about Joan
				of Arc. And certainly he never did a better piece of work than
				&#8220;Prince and Pauper.&#8221; One seems to get at the very heart of old
				England in that dearest of children&#8217;s books, and in its pages
				the frail boy king, and his gloomy sister Mary who in her day
				wrought so much woe for unhappy England, and the dashing
				Princess Elizabeth who lived to rule so well, seem to live
				again. A friend of Mr. Clemens&#8217; once told me that he said he
				wrote that book so that when his little daughters grew up
				they might know that their tired old jester of a father could be
				serious and gentle sometimes.</p>

			<h3 class="essay_title">William Dean Howells <a class="return_toc" href="#contents" title="Return to Contents">ToC</a></h3>

			<p class="first_paragraph">Certainly now in his old age Mr. Howells is selecting
			queer titles for his books. A while ago we had that feeble
			tale, &#8220;The Coast of Bohemia,&#8221; and now we have &#8220;My
			Literary Passions.&#8221; &#8220;Passions,&#8221; literary or otherwise, were
			never Mr. Howells&#8217; forte and surely no man could be further
			from even the coast of Bohemia.</p>

			<p>Apropos of &#8220;My Literary Passions&#8221; which has so long
			strung out in the Ladies&#8217; Home Journal along with those
			thrilling articles about how Henry Ward Beecher tied his
			necktie and what kind of coffee Mrs. Hall Cain likes, why did
			Mr. Howells write it? Doesn&#8217;t Mr. Howells know that at one
			time or another every one raves over Don Quixote, imitates
			Heine, worships Tourgueneff and calls Tolstoi a prophet?
			Does Mr. Howells think that no one but he ever had youth
			and enthusiasm and aspirations? Doesn&#8217;t he know that the
			only thing that makes the world worth living in at all is that
			once, when we are young, we all have that great love for
			books and impersonal things, all reverence and dream? We
			have all known the time when Porthos, Athos and d&#8217;Artagan
			were vastly more real and important to us than the folks who
			lived next door. We have all dwelt in that country where Anna
			Karenina and the Levins were the only people who mattered
			much. We have all known that intoxicating period when we
			thought we &#8220;understood life,&#8221; because we had read Daudet,
			Zola and Guy de Maupassant, and like Mr. Howells we all
			looked back rather fondly upon the time when we believed
			that books were the truth and art was all. After a while books
			grow matter of fact like everything else and we always think
			enviously of the days when they were new and wonderful and
			strange. That&#8217;s a part of existence. We lose our first keen relish
			for literature just as we lose it for ice-cream and confectionery.
			The taste grows older, wiser and more subdued. We
			would all wear out of very enthusiasm if it did not. But why

				<p class="first_paragraph">The Shakespeare society of New York, which is really
				about the only useful literary organization in this country,
				is making vigorous efforts to redress an old wrong and
				atone for a long neglect. Sunday, Sept. 22, it held a meeting at
				the Poe cottage on Kingsbridge road near Fordham, for the
				purpose of starting an organized movement to buy back the
				cottage, restore it to its original condition and preserve it as a
				memorial of Poe. So it has come at last. After helping build
				monuments to Shelley, Keats and Carlyle we have at last remembered
				this man, the greatest of our poets and the most
				unhappy. I am glad that this movement is in the hands of
				American actors, for it was among them that Poe found his
				best friends and warmest admirers. Some way he always
				seemed to belong to the strolling Thespians who were his
				mother&#8217;s people.</p>

				<p>Among all the thousands of life&#8217;s little ironies that make
				history so diverting, there is none more paradoxical than that
				Edgar Poe should have been an American. Look at his face.
				Had we ever another like it? He must have been a strange
				figure in his youth, among those genial, courtly Virginians,
				this handsome, pale fellow, violent in his enthusiasm, ardent
				<a class="pagenum" id="page213" title="213">&nbsp;</a>in his worship, but spiritually cold in his affections. Now
				playing heavily for the mere excitement of play, now worshipping
				at the shrine of a woman old enough to be his mother,
				merely because her voice was beautiful; now swimming six
				miles up the James river against a heavy current in the glaring
				sun of a June midday. He must have seemed to them an unreal
				figure, a sort of stage man who was wandering about the
				streets with his mask and buskins on, a theatrical figure who
				had escaped by some strange mischance into the prosaic daylight.
				His speech and actions were unconsciously and sincerely
				dramatic, always as though done for effect. He had that
				nervous, egotistic, self-centered nature common to stage children
				who seem to have been dazzled by the footlights and
				maddened by the applause before they are born. It was in his
				blood. With the exception of two women who loved him,
				lived for him, died for him, he went through life friendless,
				misunderstood, with that dense, complete, hopeless misunderstanding
				which, as Amiel said, is the secret of that sad
				smile upon the lips of the great. Men tried to befriend him,
				but in some way or other he hurt and disappointed them. He
				tried to mingle and share with other men, but he was always
				shut from them by that shadow, light as gossamer but unyielding
				as adamant, by which, from the beginning of the
				world, art has shielded and guarded and protected her own,
				that God-concealing mist in which the heroes of old were
				hidden, immersed in that gloom and solitude which, if we
				could but know it here, is but the shadow of God&#8217;s hand as it
				falls upon his elect.</p>

				<p>We lament our dearth of great prose. With the exception of
				Henry James and Hawthorne, Poe is our only master of pure
				prose. We lament our dearth of poets. With the exception of
				Lowell, Poe is our only great poet. Poe found short story
				writing a bungling makeshift. He left it a perfect art. He
				wrote the first perfect short stories in the English language.
				He first gave the short story purpose, method, and artistic
				form. In a careless reading one can not realize the wonderful
				literary art, the cunning devices, the masterly effects that
				those entrancing tales conceal. They are simple and direct
				enough to delight us when we are children, subtle and artistic
				enough to be our marvel when we are old. To this day they
				<a class="pagenum" id="page214" title="214">&nbsp;</a>are the wonder and admiration of the French, who are
				the acknowledged masters of craft and form. How in his wandering,
				laborious life, bound to the hack work of the press
				and crushed by an ever-growing burden of want and debt,
				did he ever come upon all this deep and mystical lore, this
				knowledge of all history, of all languages, of all art, this penetration
				into the hidden things of the East? As Steadman says,
				&#8220;The self training of genius is always a marvel.&#8221; The past is
				spread before us all and most of us spend our lives in learning
				those things which we do not need to know, but genius
				reaches out instinctively and takes only the vital detail, by
				some sort of spiritual gravitation goes directly to the right
				thing.</p>

				<p>Poe belonged to the modern French school of decorative
				and discriminating prose before it ever existed in France. He
				rivalled Gautier, Flaubert and de Maupassant before they
				were born. He clothed his tales in a barbaric splendor and
				persuasive unreality never before heard of in English. No such
				profusion of color, oriental splendor of detail, grotesque combinations
				and mystical effects had ever before been wrought
				into language. There are tales as grotesque, as monstrous, unearthly
				as the stone griffens and gargoyles that are cut up
				among the unvisited niches and towers of Notre Dame, stories
				as poetic and delicately beautiful as the golden lace work
				chased upon an Etruscan ring. He fitted his words together as
				the Byzantine jewelers fitted priceless stones. He found the
				inner harmony and kinship of words. Where lived another
				man who could blend the beautiful and the horrible, the gorgeous
				and the grotesque in such intricate and inexplicable
				fashion? Who could delight you with his noun and disgust
				you with his verb, thrill you with his adjective and chill you
				with his adverb, make you run the whole gamut of human
				emotions in a single sentence? Sitting in that miserable cottage
				at Fordham he wrote of the splendor of dream palaces
				beyond the dreams of art. He hung those grimy walls with
				dream tapestries, paved those narrow halls with black marble
				and polished onyx, and into those low-roofed chambers he
				brought all the treasured imagery of fancy, from the &#8220;huge
				carvings of untutored Egypt&#8221; to &#8220;mingled and conflicting
				perfumes, reeking up from strange convolute censers, together
				<a class="pagenum" id="page215" title="215">&nbsp;</a>with multitudinous, flaring and flickering tongues of
				purple and violet fire.&#8221; Hungry and ragged he wrote of Epicurean
				feasts and luxury that would have beggared the
				purpled pomp of pagan Rome and put Nero and his Golden
				House to shame.</p>

				<p>And this mighty master of the organ of language, who
				knew its every stop and pipe, who could awaken at will the
				thin silver tones of its slenderest reeds or the solemn cadence
				of its deepest thunder, who could make it sing like a flute or
				roar like a cataract, he was born into a country without a
				literature. He was of that ornate school which usually comes
				last in a national literature, and he came first. American taste
				had been vitiated by men like Griswold and N. P. Willis until
				it was at the lowest possible ebb. Willis was considered a
				genius, that is the worst that could possibly be said. In the
				North a new race of great philosophers was growing up, but
				Poe had neither their friendship nor encouragement. He went
				indeed, sometimes, to the chilly <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">salon</em> of Margaret Fuller, but
				he was always a discord there. He was a mere artist and he
				had no business with philosophy, he had no theories as to the
				&#8220;higher life&#8221; and the &#8220;true happiness.&#8221; He had only his unshapen
				dreams that battled with him in dark places, the unborn
				that struggled in his brain for birth. What time has an
				artist to learn the multiplication table or to talk philosophy?
				He was not afraid of them. He laughed at Willis, and flung
				Longfellow&#8217;s lie in his teeth, the lie the rest of the world was
				twenty years in finding. He scorned the obtrusive learning of
				the transcendentalists and he disliked their hard talkative
				women. He left them and went back to his dream women, his
				<em>Berenice</em>, his <em>Ligeia</em>, his <em>Marchesa Aphrodite</em>, pale and cold as
				the mist maidens of the North, sad as the Norns who weep
				for human woe.</p>

				<p>The tragedy of Poe&#8217;s life was not alcohol, but hunger. He
				died when he was forty, when his work was just beginning.
				Thackeray had not touched his great novels at forty, George
				Eliot was almost unknown at that age. Hugo, Goethe, Hawthorne,
				Lowell and Dumas all did their great work after they
				were forty years old. Poe never did his great work. He could
				not endure the hunger. This year the Drexel Institute has put
				over sixty thousand dollars into a new edition of Poe&#8217;s poems
				<a class="pagenum" id="page216" title="216">&nbsp;</a>and stories. He himself never got six thousand for them altogether.
				If one of the great and learned institutions of the land
				had invested one tenth of that amount in the living author
				forty years ago we should have had from him such works as
				would have made the name of this nation great. But he sold
				&#8220;The Masque of the Red Death&#8221; for a few dollars, and now
				the Drexel Institute pays a publisher thousands to publish it
				beautifully. It is enough to make Satan laugh until his ribs
				ache, and all the little devils laugh and heap on fresh coals. I
				don&#8217;t wonder they hate humanity. It&#8217;s so dense, so hopelessly
				stupid.</p>

				<p>Only a few weeks before Poe&#8217;s death he said he had never
				had time or opportunity to make a serious effort. All his tales
				were merely experiments, thrown off when his day&#8217;s work as
				a journalist was over, when he should have been asleep. All
				those voyages into the mystical unknown, into the gleaming,
				impalpable kingdom of pure romance from which he brought
				back such splendid trophies, were but experiments. He was
				only getting his tools into shape getting ready for his great
				effort, the effort that never came.</p>

				<p>Bread seems a little thing to stand in the way of genius,
				but it can. The simple sordid facts were these, that in the
				bitterest storms of winter Poe seldom wrote by a fire, that
				after he was twenty-five years old he never knew what it was
				to have enough to eat without dreading tomorrow&#8217;s hunger.
				Chatterton had only himself to sacrifice, but Poe saw the
				woman he loved die of want before his very eyes, die smiling
				and begging him not to give up his work. They saw the
				depths together in those long winter nights when she lay in
				that cold room, wrapped in Poe&#8217;s only coat, he, with one
				hand holding hers, and with the other dashing off some of
				the most perfect masterpieces of English prose. And when he
				would wince and turn white at her coughing, she would
				always whisper: &#8220;Work on, my poet, and when you have
				finished read it to me. I am happy when I listen.&#8221; O, the
				devotion of women and the madness of art! They are the two
				most awesome things on earth, and surely this man knew
				both to the full.</p>

				<p>I have wondered so often how he did it. How he kept his
				purpose always clean and his taste always perfect. How it was
				<a class="pagenum" id="page217" title="217">&nbsp;</a>that hard labor never wearied nor jaded him, never limited
				his imagination, that the jarring clamor about him never
				drowned the fine harmonies of his fancy. His discrimination
				remained always delicate, and from the constant strain of
				toil his fancy always rose strong and unfettered. Without
				encouragement or appreciation of any sort, without models
				or precedents he built up that pure style of his that is without
				peer in the language, that style of which every sentence
				is a drawing by Vedder. Elizabeth Barrett and a few great
				artists over in France knew what he was doing, they knew
				that in literature he was making possible a new heaven and a
				new earth. But he never knew that they knew it. He died
				without the assurance that he was or ever would be understood.
				And yet through all this, with the whole world of art
				and letters against him, betrayed by his own people, he
				managed to keep that lofty ideal of perfect work. What he
				suffered never touched or marred his work, but it wrecked his
				character. Poe&#8217;s character was made by his necessity. He was a
				liar and an egotist; a man who had to beg for bread at the
				hands of his publishers and critics could be nothing but a liar,
				and had he not had the insane egotism and conviction of
				genius, he would have broken down and written the drivelling
				trash that his countrymen delighted to read. Poe lied to
				his publishers sometimes, there is no doubt of that, but there
				were two to whom he was never false, his wife and his muse.
				He drank sometimes too, when for very ugly and relentless
				reasons he could not eat. And then he forgot what he suffered.
				For Bacchus is the kindest of the gods after all. When
				Aphrodite has fooled us and left us and Athene has betrayed
				us in battle, then poor tipsy Bacchus, who covers his head
				with vine leaves where the curls are getting thin, holds out his
				cup to us and says, &#8220;forget.&#8221; It&#8217;s poor consolation, but he
				means it well.</p>

				<p>The Transcendentalists were good conversationalists, that
				in fact was their principal accomplishment. They used to talk
				a great deal of genius, that rare and capricious spirit that visits
				earth so seldom, that is wooed by so many, and won by so
				few. They had grand theories that all men should be poets,
				that the visits of that rare spirit should be made as frequent
				and universal as afternoon calls. O, they had plans to make a
				<a class="pagenum" id="page218" title="218">&nbsp;</a>whole generation of little geniuses. But she only laughed her
				scornful laughter, that deathless lady of the immortals, up in
				her echoing chambers that are floored with dawn and roofed
				with the spangled stars. And she snatched from them the only
				man of their nation she had ever deigned to love, whose lips
				she had touched with music and whose soul with song. In his
				youth she had shown him the secrets of her beauty and his
				manhood had been one pursuit of her, blind to all else, like
				Anchises, who on the night that he knew the love of Venus,
				was struck sightless, that he might never behold the face of a
				mortal woman. For Our Lady of Genius has no care for the
				prayers and groans of mortals, nor for their hecatombs sweet
				of savor. Many a time of old she has foiled the plans of seers
				and none may entreat her or take her by force. She favors no
				one nation or clime. She takes one from the millions, and
				when she gives herself unto a man it is without his will or that
				of his fellows, and he pays for it, dear heaven, he pays!</p>

				<blockquote class="poem">
					<p>&#8220;The sun comes forth and many reptiles spawn,</p>
					<p>He sets and each ephemeral insect then</p>
					<p>Is gathered unto death without a dawn,</p>
					<p>And the immortal stars awake again.&#8221;</p>
				</blockquote>

				<p>Yes, &#8220;and the immortal stars awake again.&#8221; None may
				thwart the unerring justice of the gods, not even the Transcendentalists.
				What matter that one man&#8217;s life was miserable,
				that one man was broken on the wheel? His work lives and
				his crown is eternal. That the work of his age was undone,
				that is the pity, that the work of his youth was done, that is
				the glory. The man is nothing. There are millions of men.
				The work is everything. There is so little perfection. We
				lament our dearth of poets when we let Poe starve. We are like
				the Hebrews who stoned their prophets and then marvelled
				that the voice of God was silent. We will wait a long time for
				another. There are Griswold and N. P. Willis, our chosen
				ones, let us turn to them. Their names are forgotten. God is
				just. They are,</p>

				<blockquote class="poem">
					<p>&#8220;Gathered unto death without a dawn.</p>

				<p>You can afford to give a little more care and attention to
				this imaginative boy of yours than to any of your other children.
				His nerves are more finely strung and all his life he will
				need your love more than the others. Be careful to get him
				the books he likes and see that they are good ones. Get him a
				volume of Poe&#8217;s short stories. I know many people are prejudiced
				against Poe because of the story that he drank himself to
				death. But that myth has been exploded long ago. Poe drank
				less than even the average man of his time. No, the most
				artistic of all American story tellers did not die because he
				drank too much, but because he ate too little. And yet we, his
				own countrymen who should be so proud of him, are not
				content with having starved him and wronged him while he
				lived, we must even go on slandering him after he has been
				dead almost fifty years. But get his works for this imaginative
				boy of yours and he will tell you how great a man the author
				of &#8220;The Gold Bug&#8221; and &#8220;The Masque of the Red Death&#8221;
				was. Children are impartial critics and sometimes very good
				ones. They do not reason about a book, they just like it or
				dislike it intensely, and after all that is the conclusion of the
				whole matter. I am very sure that &#8220;The Fall of the House of
				Usher,&#8221; &#8220;The Pit and the Pendulum&#8221; and &#8220;The Black Cat&#8221;
				will give this woolgathering lad of yours more pleasure than a
				new bicycle could.</p>

			<h3 class="essay_title">Walt Whitman <a class="return_toc" href="#contents" title="Return to Contents">ToC</a></h3>

			<p class="first_paragraph">Speaking of monuments reminds one that there is more
			talk about a monument to Walt Whitman, &#8220;the good,
			gray poet.&#8221; Just why the adjective good is always applied to
			Whitman it is difficult to discover, probably because people
			who could not understand him at all took it for granted that
			he meant well. If ever there was a poet who had no literary
			ethics at all beyond those of nature, it was he. He was neither
			good nor bad, any more than are the animals he continually
			admired and envied. He was a poet without an exclusive sense
			of the poetic, a man without the finer discriminations, enjoying
			everything with the unreasoning enthusiasm of a boy. He
			was the poet of the dung hill as well as of the mountains,
			which is admirable in theory but excruciating in verse. In the
			same paragraph he informs you that, &#8220;The pure contralto
			sings in the organ loft,&#8221; and that &#8220;The malformed limbs are
			tied to the table, what is removed drop horribly into a pail.&#8221;
			No branch of surgery is poetic, and that hopelessly prosaic
			word &#8220;pail&#8221; would kill a whole volume of sonnets. Whitman&#8217;s
			poems are reckless rhapsodies over creation in general, some
			times sublime, some times ridiculous. He declares that the
			ocean with its &#8220;imperious waves, commanding&#8221; is beautiful,
			and that the fly-specks on the walls are also beautiful. Such
			catholic taste may go in science, but in poetry their results are
			sad. The poet&#8217;s task is usually to select the poetic. Whitman
			never bothers to do that, he takes everything in the universe
			from fly-specks to the fixed stars. His &#8220;Leaves of Grass&#8221; is a
			sort of dictionary of the English language, and in it is the
			name of everything in creation set down with great reverence
			but without any particular connection.</p>

			<p>But however ridiculous Whitman may be there is a primitive
			elemental force about him. He is so full of hardiness and
			of the joy of life. He looks at all nature in the delighted, admiring
			way in which the old Greeks and the primitive poets
			did. He exults so in the red blood in his body and the
			strength in his arms. He has such a passion for the warmth
			and dignity of all that is natural. He has no code but to be
			<a class="pagenum" id="page221" title="221">&nbsp;</a>natural, a code that this complex world has so long outgrown.
			He is sensual, not after the manner of Swinbourne and Gautier,
			who are always seeking for perverted and bizarre effects
			on the senses, but in the frank fashion of the old barbarians
			who ate and slept and married and smacked their lips over the
			mead horn. He is rigidly limited to the physical, things that
			quicken his pulses, please his eyes or delight his nostrils.
			There is an element of poetry in all this, but it is by no means
			the highest. If a joyous elephant should break forth into song,
			his lay would probably be very much like Whitman&#8217;s famous
			&#8220;song of myself.&#8221; It would have just about as much delicacy
			and deftness and discriminations. He says:</p>

			<p>&#8220;I think I could turn and live with the animals. They are so
			placid and self-contained, I stand and look at them long and
			long. They do not sweat and whine about their condition.
			They do not lie awake in the dark and weep for their sins.
			They do not make me sick discussing their duty to God. Not
			one is dissatisfied nor not one is demented with the mania of
			many things. Not one kneels to another nor to his kind that
			lived thousands of years ago. Not one is respectable or
			unhappy, over the whole earth.&#8221; And that is not irony on
			nature, he means just that, life meant no more to him.
			He accepted the world just as it is and glorified it, the seemly
			and unseemly, the good and the bad. He had no conception
			of a difference in people or in things. All men had bodies
			and were alike to him, one about as good as another. To live
			was to fulfil all natural laws and impulses. To be comfortable
			was to be happy. To be happy was the ultimatum. He did
			not realize the existence of a conscience or a responsibility.
			He had no more thought of good or evil than the folks in
			Kipling&#8217;s Jungle book.</p>

			<p>And yet there is an undeniable charm about this optimistic
			vagabond who is made so happy by the warm sunshine and
			the smell of spring fields. A sort of good fellowship and
			whole-heartedness in every line he wrote. His veneration for
			things physical and material, for all that is in water or air or
			land, is so real that as you read him you think for the moment
			that you would rather like to live so if you could. For the time
			you half believe that a sound body and a strong arm are the
			greatest things in the world. Perhaps no book shows so much
			<a class="pagenum" id="page222" title="222">&nbsp;</a>as &#8220;Leaves of Grass&#8221; that keen senses do not make a poet.
			When you read it you realize how spirited a thing poetry
			really is and how great a part spiritual perceptions play in
			apparently sensuous verse, if only to select the beautiful from
			the gross.</p>

				<p class="first_paragraph">Their mania for careless and hasty work is not confined
				to the lesser men. Howells and Hardy have gone with
				the crowd. Now that Stevenson is dead I can think of but one
				English speaking author who is really keeping his self-respect
				and sticking for perfection. Of course I refer to that mighty
				master of language and keen student of human actions and
				motives, Henry James. In the last four years he has published,
				I believe, just two small volumes, &#8220;The Lesson of the Master&#8221;
				and &#8220;Terminations,&#8221; and in those two little volumes of short
				stories he who will may find out something of what it means
				to be really an artist. The framework is perfect and the polish
				is absolutely without flaw. They are sometimes a little hard,
				always calculating and dispassionate, but they are perfect. I
				wish James would write about modern society, about &#8220;degeneracy&#8221;
				and the new woman and all the rest of it. Not that he
				would throw any light on it. He seldom does; but he would
				say such awfully clever things about it, and turn on so many
				side-lights. And then his sentences! If his character novels
				were all wrong one could read him forever for the mere
				beauty of his sentences. He never lets his phrases run away
				with him. They are never dull and never too brilliant. He
				subjects them to the general tone of his sentence and has his
				whole paragraph partake of the same predominating color.
				You are never startled, never surprised, never thrilled or never
				enraptured; always delighted by that masterly prose that is as
				correct, as classical, as calm and as subtle as the music of

				<p>It is strange that from &#8220;Felicia&#8221; down, the stage novel has

				write passing well of the people who enact them. He has put
				into one book all those inevitable attendants of the drama, the
				patronizing theatre goer who loves it above all things and yet
				feels so far superior to it personally; the old tragedienne, the
				queen of a dying school whose word is law and whose judgments

				beats and beats upon those brazen doors that guard the unapproachable
				until one fine morning she beats them down and
				comes into her kingdom, the kingdom of unborn beauty that

			<p class="work_reviewed">&#8220;THE MARKET-PLACE.&#8221; Harold Frederic. $1.50. New York:
			F. A. Stokes &amp; Co. Pittsburg: J. R. Weldin &amp; Co.</p>

			<p class="first_paragraph">Unusual interest is attached to the posthumous work
			of that great man whose career ended so prematurely
			and so tragically. The story is a study in the ethics and purposes
			of money-getting, in the romantic element in modern
			business. In it finance is presented not as being merely the
			province of shrewdness, or greediness, or petty personal gratification,
			but of great projects, of great brain-battles, a field
			for the exercising of talent, daring, imagination, appealing to
			the strength of a strong man, filling the same place in men&#8217;s
			lives that was once filled by the incentives of war, kindling in
			man the desire for the leadership of men. The hero of the
			story, &#8220;Joel Thorpe,&#8221; is one of those men, huge of body, keen
			of brain, with cast iron nerves, as sound a heart as most men,
			and a magnificent capacity for bluff. He has lived and risked
			and lost in a dozen countries, been almost within reach of
			fortune a dozen times, and always missed her until, finally, in
			London, by promoting a great rubber syndicate he becomes a
			multi-millionaire. He marries the most beautiful and one of
			the most impecunious peeresses in England and retires to his
			country estate. There, as a gentleman of leisure, he loses his
			motive in life, loses power for lack of opportunity, and grows
			less commanding even in the eyes of his wife, who misses the
			uncompromising, barbaric strength which took her by storm
			and won her. Finally he evolves a gigantic philanthropic
			scheme of spending his money as laboriously as he made it.</p>

			<p>Mr. Frederic says:</p>

			<blockquote>
				<p>&#8220;Napoleon was the greatest man of his age&#8212;one of the
				greatest men of all ages&#8212;not only in war but in a hundred
				other ways. He spent the last six years of his life at St. Helena
				in excellent health, with companions that he talked freely to,
				and in all the extraordinarily copious reports of his conversations
				there, we don&#8217;t get a single sentence worth repeating.
				The greatness had entirely evaporated from him the moment
				he was put on an island where he had nothing to do.&#8221;</p>
			</blockquote>

			<p><a class="pagenum" id="page226" title="226">&nbsp;</a>It is very fitting that Mr. Frederic&#8217;s last book should be in
			praise of action, the thing that makes the world go round; of
			force, however misspent, which is the sum of life as distinguished
			from the inertia of death. In the forty-odd years of
			his life he wrote almost as many pages as Balzac, most of it
			mere newspaper copy, it is true, read and forgotten, but all of
			it vigorous and with the stamp of a strong man upon it. And
			he played just as hard as he worked&#8212;alas, it was the play that
			killed him! The young artist who illustrated the story gave to
			the pictures of &#8220;Joel Thorpe&#8221; very much the look of Harold
			Frederic himself, and they might almost stand for his portraits.
			I fancy the young man did not select his model carelessly.
			In this big, burly adventurer who took fortune and
			women by storm, who bluffed the world by his prowess and
			fought his way to the front with battle-ax blows, there is a
			great deal of Harold Frederic, the soldier of fortune, the
			Utica milk boy who fought his way from the petty slavery of
			a provincial newspaper to the foremost ranks of the journalists
			of the world and on into literature, into literature worth
			the writing. The man won his place in England much as his
			hero won his, by defiance, by strong shoulder blows, by his
			self-sufficiency and inexhaustible strength, and when he finished
			his book he did not know that his end would be so
			much less glorious than his hero&#8217;s, that it would be his portion
			not to fall manfully in the thick of the combat and the
			press of battle, but to die poisoned in the tent of Chryseis.
			For who could foresee a tragedy so needless, so blind, so
			brutal in its lack of dignity, or know that such strength could
			perish through such insidious weakness, that so great a man
			could be stung to death by a mania born in little minds?</p>

			<p>In point of execution and literary excellence, both &#8220;The
			Market Place&#8221; and &#8220;Gloria Mundi&#8221; are vastly inferior to &#8220;The
			Damnation of Theron Ware,&#8221; or that exquisite London idyl,
			&#8220;March Hares.&#8221; The first 200 pages of &#8220;Theron Ware&#8221; are
			as good as anything in American fiction, much better than
			most of it. They are not so much the work of a literary
			artist as of a vigorous thinker, a man of strong opinions and
			an intimate and comprehensive knowledge of men. The
			whole work, despite its irregularities and indifference to form,
			is full of brain stuff, the kind of active, healthful, masterful
			<a class="pagenum" id="page227" title="227">&nbsp;</a>intellect that some men put into politics, some into science
			and a few, a very few, into literature. Both &#8220;Gloria Mundi&#8221;
			and &#8220;The Market Place&#8221; bear unmistakable evidences of the
			slack rein and the hasty hand. Both of them contain considerable
			padding, the stamp of the space writer. They are imperfectly
			developed, and are not packed with ideas like his earlier
			novels. Their excellence is in flashes; it is not the searching,
			evenly distributed light which permeates his more careful
			work. There were, as we know too well, good reasons why
			Mr. Frederic should work hastily. He needed a large income
			and he worked heroically, writing many thousands of words a
			day to obtain it. From the experience of the ages we have
			learned to expect to find, coupled with great strength, a proportionate
			weakness, and usually it devours the greater part,
			as the seven lean kine devoured the seven fat in Pharaoh&#8217;s
			vision. Achilles was a god in all his nobler parts, but his feet
			were of the earth and to the earth they held him down, and
			he died stung by an arrow in the heel.</p>

			<h3 class="essay_title">Kate Chopin <a class="return_toc" href="#contents" title="Return to Contents">ToC</a></h3>
			<p class="work_reviewed">&#8220;THE AWAKENING.&#8221; Kate Chopin. $1.25. Chicago: H. S.
			Stone &amp; Co. Pittsburg: J. R. Weldin &amp; Co.</p>

			<p class="first_paragraph">A Creole &#8220;Bovary&#8221; is this little novel of Miss Chopin&#8217;s.
			Not that the heroine is a creole exactly, or that Miss
			Chopin is a Flaubert&#8212;save the mark!&#8212;but the theme is similar
			to that which occupied Flaubert. There was, indeed, no
			need that a second &#8220;Madame Bovary&#8221; should be written, but
			an author&#8217;s choice of themes is frequently as inexplicable as
			his choice of a wife. It is governed by some innate temperamental
			bias that cannot be diagrammed. This is particularly so
			in women who write, and I shall not attempt to say why Miss
			Chopin has devoted so exquisite and sensitive, well-governed
			a style to so trite and sordid a theme. She writes much better
			than it is ever given to most people to write, and hers is a
			genuinely literary style; of no great elegance or solidity; but
			light, flexible, subtle and capable of producing telling effects
			directly and simply. The story she has to tell in the present
			instance is new neither in matter nor treatment. &#8220;Edna Pontellier,&#8221;
			a Kentucky girl, who, like &#8220;Emma Bovary,&#8221; had been in
			love with innumerable dream heroes before she was out of
			short skirts, married &#8220;Leonce Pontellier&#8221; as a sort of reaction
			from a vague and visionary passion for a tragedian whose unresponsive
			picture she used to kiss. She acquired the habit of
			liking her husband in time, and even of liking her children.
			Though we are not justified in presuming that she ever threw
			articles from her dressing table at them, as the charming
			&#8220;Emma&#8221; had a winsome habit of doing, we are told that &#8220;she
			would sometimes gather them passionately to her heart, she
			would sometimes forget them.&#8221; At a creole watering place,
			which is admirably and deftly sketched by Miss Chopin,
			&#8220;Edna&#8221; met &#8220;Robert Lebrun,&#8221; son of the landlady, who
			dreamed of a fortune awaiting him in Mexico while he occupied
			a petty clerical position in New Orleans. &#8220;Robert&#8221; made
			it his business to be agreeable to his mother&#8217;s boarders, and
			&#8220;Edna,&#8221; not being a creole, much against his wish and will,
			took him seriously. &#8220;Robert&#8221; went to Mexico but found that
			<a class="pagenum" id="page229" title="229">&nbsp;</a>fortunes were no easier to make there than in New Orleans.
			He returns and does not even call to pay his respects to her.
			She encounters him at the home of a friend and takes him
			home with her. She wheedles him into staying for dinner, and
			we are told she sent the maid off &#8220;in search of some delicacy
			she had not thought of for herself, and she recommended
			great care in the dripping of the coffee and having the omelet
			done to a turn.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Only a few pages back we were informed that the husband,
			&#8220;M. Pontellier,&#8221; had cold soup and burnt fish for his dinner.
			Such is life. The lover of course disappointed her, was a coward
			and ran away from his responsibilities before they began.
			He was afraid to begin a chapter with so serious and limited a
			woman. She remembered the sea where she had first met
			&#8220;Robert.&#8221; Perhaps from the same motive which threw &#8220;Anna
			Keraninna&#8221; under the engine wheels, she threw herself into
			the sea, swam until she was tired and then let go.</p>

			<blockquote>
				<p>&#8220;She looked into the distance, and for a moment the
				old terror flamed up, then sank again. She heard her
				father&#8217;s voice, and her sister Margaret&#8217;s. She heard the
				barking of an old dog that was chained to the sycamore
				tree. The spurs of the cavalry officer clanged as he
				walked across the porch. There was a hum of bees, and
				the musky odor of pinks filled the air.&#8221;</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>&#8220;Edna Pontellier&#8221; and &#8220;Emma Bovary&#8221; are studies in the
			same feminine type; one a finished and complete portrayal,
			the other a hasty sketch, but the theme is essentially the same.
			Both women belong to a class, not large, but forever clamoring
			in our ears, that demands more romance out of life than
			God put into it. Mr. G. Barnard Shaw would say that they are
			the victims of the over-idealization of love. They are the spoil
			of the poets, the Iphigenias of sentiment. The unfortunate
			feature of their disease is that it attacks only women of brains,
			at least of rudimentary brains, but whose development is one-sided;
			women of strong and fine intuitions, but without the
			faculty of observation, comparison, reasoning about things.
			Probably, for emotional people, the most convenient thing
			about being able to think is that it occasionally gives them a
			rest from feeling. Now with women of the &#8220;Bovary&#8221; type,
			<a class="pagenum" id="page230" title="230">&nbsp;</a>this relaxation and recreation is impossible. They are not critics
			of life, but, in the most personal sense, partakers of life.
			They receive impressions through the fancy. With them
			everything begins with fancy, and passions rise in the brain
			rather than in the blood, the poor, neglected, limited one-sided
			brain that might do so much better things than badgering
			itself into frantic endeavors to love. For these are the
			people who pay with their blood for the fine ideals of the
			poets, as Marie Delclasse paid for Dumas&#8217; great creation,
			&#8220;Marguerite Gauthier.&#8221; These people really expect the passion
			of love to fill and gratify every need of life, whereas nature
			only intended that it should meet one of many demands.
			They insist upon making it stand for all the emotional pleasures
			of life and art, expecting an individual and self-limited
			passion to yield infinite variety, pleasure and distraction, to
			contribute to their lives what the arts and the pleasurable
			exercise of the intellect gives to less limited and less intense
			idealists. So this passion, when set up against Shakespeare,
			Balzac, Wagner, Raphael, fails them. They have staked everything
			on one hand, and they lose. They have driven the blood
			until it will drive no further, they have played their nerves up
			to the point where any relaxation short of absolute annihilation
			is impossible. Every idealist abuses his nerves, and every
			sentimentalist brutally abuses them. And in the end, the
			nerves get even. Nobody ever cheats them, really. Then &#8220;the
			awakening&#8221; comes. Sometimes it comes in the form of arsenic,
			as it came to &#8220;Emma Bovary,&#8221; sometimes it is carbolic
			acid taken covertly in the police station, a goal to which unbalanced
			idealism not infrequently leads. &#8220;Edna Pontellier,&#8221;
			fanciful and romantic to the last, chose the sea on a summer
			night and went down with the sound of her first lover&#8217;s spurs
			in her ears, and the scent of pinks about her. And next time I
			hope that Miss Chopin will devote that flexible, iridescent
			style of hers to a better cause.</p>

				<p class="work_reviewed">&#8220;WAR IS KIND.&#8221; Stephen Crane. $2.50. New York: F. A.
				Stokes &amp; Co. Pittsburg: J. R. Weldin &amp; Co.</p>

				<p class="first_paragraph">This truly remarkable book is printed on dirty gray
				blotting paper, on each page of which is a mere dot of
				print over a large I of vacancy. There are seldom more than
				ten lines on a page, and it would be better if most of those
				lines were not there at all. Either Mr. Crane is insulting the
				public or insulting himself, or he has developed a case of atavism
				and is chattering the primeval nonsense of the apes. His
				&#8220;Black Riders,&#8221; uneven as it was, was a casket of polished
				masterpieces when compared with &#8220;War Is Kind.&#8221; And it is
				not kind at all, Mr. Crane; when it provokes such verses as
				these, it is all that Sherman said it was.</p>

				<p>The only production in the volume that is at all coherent is
				the following, from which the book gets its title:</p>

				<blockquote class="poem">
					<div class="stanza">
						<p>Do not weep, maiden, for war is kind,</p>
						<p>Because your lover threw wild hands toward the sky,</p>
						<p>And the affrighted steed ran on alone.</p>
						<p class="i16">Do not weep,</p>
						<p class="i16">War is kind.</p>
					</div>

					<div class="stanza">
						<p>Hoarse booming drums of the regiment,</p>
						<p>Little souls who thirst for fight,</p>
						<p class="i4">These men were born to drill and die.</p>
						<p>The unexplained glory flies above them.</p>
						<p>Great is the battle-god, great, and his kingdom&#8212;</p>
						<p class="i4">A field where a thousand corpses lie.</p>
					</div>

					<div class="stanza">
						<p>Do not weep, babe, for war is kind,</p>
						<p>Because your father tumbled in the yellow trenches,</p>
						<p>Raged at the breast, gulped and died.</p>
						<p class="i16">Do not weep,</p>
						<p class="i16">War is kind.</p>
					</div>

					<div class="stanza">
						<p>Swift-blazing flag of the regiment,</p>
						<p>Eagle with crest of red and gold,</p>
						<p class="i4"><a class="pagenum" id="page232" title="232">&nbsp;</a>These men were born to drill and die.</p>
						<p>Point for them the virtue of slaughter,</p>
						<p>Make plain to them the excellence of killing,</p>
						<p class="i4">And a field where a thousand corpses lie.</p>
					</div>

					<div class="stanza">
						<p>Mother whose heart hung humble as a button</p>
						<p>On the bright, splendid shroud of your son,</p>
						<p class="i16">Do not weep,</p>
						<p class="i16">War is kind.</p>
					</div>
				</blockquote>

				<p>Of course, one may have objections to hearts hanging like
				humble buttons, or to buttons being humble at all, but one
				should not stop to quarrel about such trifles with a poet who
				can perpetrate the following:</p>

				<blockquote class="poem">
					<div class="stanza">
						<p>Thou art my love,</p>
						<p>And thou art the beard</p>
						<p>On another man&#8217;s face&#8212;</p>
						<p>Woe is me.</p>
					</div>

					<div class="stanza">
						<p>Thou art my love,</p>
						<p>And thou art a temple,</p>
						<p>And in this temple is an altar,</p>
						<p>And on this temple is my heart&#8212;</p>
						<p>Woe is me.</p>
					</div>

					<div class="stanza">
						<p>Thou art my love,</p>
						<p>And thou art a wretch.</p>
						<p>Let these sacred love-lies choke thee.</p>
						<p>For I am come to where I know your lies as truth</p>
						<p>And your truth as lies&#8212;</p>
						<p>Woe is me.</p>
					</div>
				</blockquote>

				<p>Now, if you please, is the object of these verses animal,
				mineral or vegetable? Is the expression, &#8220;Thou art the beard
				on another man&#8217;s face,&#8221; intended as a figure, or was it written
				by a barber? Certainly, after reading this, &#8220;Simple Simon&#8221; is a
				ballade of perfect form, and &#8220;Jack and Jill&#8221; or &#8220;Hickity, Pickity,
				My Black Hen,&#8221; are exquisite lyrics. But of the following
				what shall be said:</p>

				<blockquote class="poem">
					<div class="stanza">
						<p>Now let me crunch you</p>
						<p>With full weight of affrighted love.</p>
						<p><a class="pagenum" id="page233" title="233">&nbsp;</a>I doubted you</p>
						<p>&#8212;I doubted you&#8212;</p>
						<p>And in this short doubting</p>
						<p>My love grew like a genie</p>
						<p>For my further undoing.</p>
					</div>

					<div class="stanza">
						<p>Beware of my friends,</p>
						<p>Be not in speech too civil,</p>
						<p>For in all courtesy</p>
						<p>My weak heart sees specters,</p>
						<p>Mists of desire</p>
						<p>Arising from the lips of my chosen;</p>
						<p>Be not civil.</p>
					</div>
				</blockquote>

				<p>This is somewhat more lucid as evincing the bard&#8217;s exquisite
				sensitiveness:</p>

				<blockquote class="poem">
					<p>Ah, God, the way your little finger moved</p>
					<p>As you thrust a bare arm backward.</p>
					<p>And made play with your hair</p>
					<p>And a comb, a silly gilt comb</p>
					<p>&#8212;Ah, God, that I should suffer</p>
					<p>Because of the way a little finger moved.</p>
				</blockquote>

				<p>Mr. Crane&#8217;s verselets are illustrated by some Bradley pictures,
				which are badly drawn, in bad taste, and come with bad
				grace. On page 33 of the book there are just two lines which
				seem to completely sum up the efforts of both poet and artist:</p>

				<blockquote>
					<p style="text-indent:0em;">&#8220;My good friend,&#8221; said a learned bystander,<br />
					   &#8220;Your operations are mad.&#8221;</p>
				</blockquote>

				<p>Yet this fellow Crane has written short stories equal to
				some of Maupassant&#8217;s.</p>

				<p class="source"><cite>Pittsburg Leader</cite>, June 3, 1899</p>
			</div>
			<div id="crane_2" class="review">
				<p>After reading such a delightful newspaper story as Mr.
				Frank Norris&#8217; &#8220;Blix,&#8221; it is with assorted sensations of pain and
				discomfort that one closes the covers of another newspaper
				novel, &#8220;Active Service,&#8221; by Stephen Crane. If one happens to
				<a class="pagenum" id="page234" title="234">&nbsp;</a>have some trifling regard for pure English, he does not come
				forth from the reading of this novel unscathed. The hero of
				this lurid tale is a newspaper man, and he edits the Sunday
				edition of the New York &#8220;Eclipse,&#8221; and delights in publishing
				&#8220;stories&#8221; about deformed and sightless infants. &#8220;The office of
				the &#8216;Eclipse&#8217; was at the top of an immense building on Broadway.
				It was a sheer mountain to the heights of which the
				interminable thunder of the streets rose faintly. The Hudson
				was a broad path of silver in the distance.&#8221; This leaves little
				doubt as to the fortunate journal which had secured Rufus
				Coleman as its Sunday editor. Mr. Coleman&#8217;s days were spent
				in collecting yellow sensations for his paper, and we are told
				that he &#8220;planned for each edition as for a campaign.&#8221; The
				following elevating passage is one of the realistic paragraphs
				by which Mr. Crane makes the routine of Coleman&#8217;s life
				known to us:</p>

				<blockquote>
					<p>Suddenly there was a flash of light and a cage of
					bronze, gilt and steel dropped magically from above.
					Coleman yelled &#8220;Down!&#8221; *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* A door flew open. Coleman
					stepped upon the elevator. &#8220;Well, Johnnie,&#8221; he said
					cheerfully to the lad who operated the machine, &#8220;is business
					good?&#8221; &#8220;Yes, sir, pretty good,&#8221; answered the boy,
					grinning. The little cage sank swiftly. Floor after floor
					seemed to be rising with marvelous speed; the whole
					building was winging straight into the sky. There was
					soaring lights, figures and the opalescent glow of
					ground glass doors marked with black inscriptions.
					Other lights were springing heavenward. All the lofty
					corridors rang with cries. &#8220;Up!&#8221; &#8220;Down!&#8221; &#8220;Down!&#8221;
					&#8220;Up!!&#8221; The boy&#8217;s hand grasped a lever and his machine
					obeyed his lightest movement with sometimes an unbalancing
					swiftness.</p>
				</blockquote>

				<p>Later, when Coleman reached the street, Mr. Crane describes
				the cable cars as marching like panoplied elephants,
				which is rather far, to say the least. The gentleman&#8217;s nights
				were spent something as follows:</p>

				<blockquote>
					<p>&#8220;In the restaurant he first ordered a large bottle of
					champagne. The last of the wine he finished in somber
					<a class="pagenum" id="page235" title="235">&nbsp;</a>mood like an unbroken and defiant man who chews the
					straw that litters his prison house. During his dinner he
					was continually sending out messenger boys. He was
					arranging a poker party. Through a window he watched
					the beautiful moving life of upper Broadway at night,
					with its crowds and clanging cable cars and its electric
					signs, mammoth and glittering like the jewels of a
					giantess.</p>

					<p>&#8220;Word was brought to him that poker players were
					arriving. He arose joyfully, leaving his cheese. In the
					broad hall, occupied mainly by miscellaneous people
					and actors, all deep in leather chairs, he found some of
					his friends waiting. They trooped upstairs to Coleman&#8217;s
					rooms, where, as a preliminary, Coleman began to hurl
					books and papers from the table to the floor. A boy
					came with drinks. Most of the men, in order to prepare
					for the game, removed their coats and cuffs and drew up
					the sleeves of their shirts. The electric globes shed a
					blinding light upon the table. The sound of clinking
					chips arose; the elected banker spun the cards, careless
					and dextrous.&#8221;</p>
				</blockquote>

				<p>The atmosphere of the entire novel is just that close and
				enervating. Every page is like the next morning taste of a
				champagne supper, and is heavy with the smell of stale cigarettes.
				There is no fresh air in the book and no sunlight, only
				the &#8220;blinding light shed by the electric globes.&#8221; If the life of
				New York newspaper men is as unwholesome and sordid as
				this, Mr. Crane, who has experienced it, ought to be sadly
				ashamed to tell it. Next morning when Coleman went for
				breakfast in the grill room of his hotel he ordered eggs on
				toast and a pint of champagne for breakfast and discoursed
				affably to the waiter.</p>

				<blockquote>
					<p>&#8220;May be you had a pretty lively time last night, Mr.
					Coleman?&#8221;</p>

					<p>&#8220;Yes, Pat,&#8221; answered Coleman. &#8220;I did. It was all because
					of an unrequitted affection, Patrick.&#8221; The man
					stood near, a napkin over his arm. Coleman went on
					impressively. &#8220;The ways of the modern lover are
					strange. Now, I, Patrick, am a modern lover, and when,
					<a class="pagenum" id="page236" title="236">&nbsp;</a>yesterday, the dagger of disappointment was driven
					deep into my heart, I immediately played poker as hard
					as I could, and incidentally got loaded. This is the modern
					point of view. I understand on good authority that
					in old times lovers used to languish. That is probably a
					lie, but at any rate we do not, in these times, languish to
					any great extent. We get drunk. Do you understand
					Patrick?&#8221;</p>

					<p>The waiter was used to a harangue at Coleman&#8217;s
					breakfast time. He placed his hand over his mouth and
					giggled. &#8220;Yessir.&#8221;</p>

					<p>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; continued Coleman, thoughtfully. &#8220;It
					might be pointed out by uneducated persons that it is
					difficult to maintain a high standard of drunkenness for
					the adequate length of time, but in the series of experiments
					which I am about to make, I am sure I can easily
					prove them to be in the wrong.&#8221;</p>

					<p>&#8220;I am sure, sir,&#8221; said the waiter, &#8220;the young ladies
					would not like to be hearing you talk this way.&#8221;</p>

					<p>&#8220;Yes; no doubt, no doubt. The young ladies have still
					quite medieval ideas. They don&#8217;t understand. They still
					prefer lovers to languish.&#8221;</p>

					<p>&#8220;At any rate, sir, I don&#8217;t see that your heart is sure
					enough broken. You seem to take it very easy.&#8221;</p>

					<p>&#8220;Broken!&#8221; cried Coleman. &#8220;Easy? Man, my heart is in
					fragments. Bring me another small bottle.&#8221;</p>
				</blockquote>

				<p>After this Coleman went to Greece to write up the war for
				the &#8220;Eclipse,&#8221; and incidentally to rescue his sweetheart from
				the hands of the Turks and make &#8220;copy&#8221; of it. Very valid arguments
				might be advanced that the lady would have fared
				better with the Turks. On the voyage Coleman spent all his
				days and nights in the card room and avoided the deck, since
				fresh air was naturally disagreeable to him. For all that he saw
				of Greece or that Mr. Crane&#8217;s readers see of Greece Coleman
				might as well have stayed in the card room of the steamer, or
				in the card room of his New York hotel for that matter.
				Wherever he goes he carries the atmosphere of the card room
				with him and the &#8220;blinding glare of the electrics.&#8221; In Greece
				he makes love when he has leisure, but he makes &#8220;copy&#8221;
				<a class="pagenum" id="page237" title="237">&nbsp;</a>much more ardently, and on the whole is quite as lurid and
				sordid and showy as his worst Sunday editions. Some good
				bits of battle descriptions there are, of the &#8220;Red Badge of
				Courage&#8221; order, but one cannot make a novel of clever descriptions
				of earthworks and poker games. The book concerns
				itself not with large, universal interests or principles, but with
				a yellow journalist grinding out yellow copy in such a
				wooden fashion that the Sunday &#8220;Eclipse&#8221; must have been
				even worse than most. In spite of the fact that Mr. Crane has
				written some of the most artistic short stories in the English
				language, I begin to wonder whether, blinded by his youth
				and audacity, two qualities which the American people love,
				we have not taken him too seriously. It is a grave matter for a
				man in good health and with a bank account to have written a
				book so coarse and dull and charmless as &#8220;Active Service.&#8221;
				Compared with this &#8220;War was kind,&#8221; indeed.</p>

			<div id="norris_1" class="review">
				<p class="first_paragraph">A new and a great book has been written. The name of it
				is &#8220;McTeague, a Story of San Francisco,&#8221; and the man
				who wrote it is Mr. Frank Norris. The great presses of the
				country go on year after year grinding out commonplace
				books, just as each generation goes on busily reproducing its
				own mediocrity. When in this enormous output of ink and
				paper, these thousands of volumes that are yearly rushed
				upon the shelves of the book stores, one appears which contains
				both power and promise, the reader may be pardoned
				some enthusiasm. Excellence always surprises: we are never
				quite prepared for it. In the case of &#8220;McTeague, a Story of
				San Francisco,&#8221; it is even more surprising than usual. In the
				first place the title is not alluring, and not until you have read
				the book, can you know that there is an admirable consistency
				in the stiff, uncompromising commonplaceness of that title.
				In the second place the name of the author is as yet comparatively
				unfamiliar, and finally the book is dedicated to a member
				of the Harvard faculty, suggesting that whether it be a
				story of San Francisco or Dawson City, it must necessarily be
				vaporous, introspective and chiefly concerned with &#8220;literary&#8221;
				impressions. Mr. Norris is, indeed, a &#8220;Harvard man,&#8221; but that
				he is a good many other kinds of a man is self-evident. His
				book is, in the language of Mr. Norman Hapgood, the work
				of &#8220;a large human being, with a firm stomach, who knows
				and loves the people.&#8221;</p>

				<p>In a novel of such high merit as this, the subject matter is
				the least important consideration. Every newspaper contains
				the essential material for another &#8220;Comedie Humaine.&#8221; In
				this case &#8220;McTeague,&#8221; the central figure, happens to be a dentist
				practicing in a little side street of San Francisco. The novel
				opens with this description of him:</p>

				<blockquote>
					<p>&#8220;It was Sunday, and, according to his custom on that
					day, McTeague took his dinner at two in the afternoon
					at the car conductor&#8217;s coffee joint on Polk street. He
					had a thick, gray soup, heavy, underdone meat, very
					hot, on a cold plate; two kinds of vegetables; and a sort
					<a class="pagenum" id="page239" title="239">&nbsp;</a>of suet pudding, full of strong butter and sugar. Once in
					his office, or, as he called it on his sign-board, &#8216;Dental
					Parlors,&#8217; he took off his coat and shoes, unbuttoned his
					vest, and, having crammed his little stove with coke, he
					lay back in his operating chair at the bay window, reading
					the paper, drinking steam beer, and smoking his
					huge porcelain pipe while his food digested; crop-full,
					stupid and warm.&#8221;</p>
				</blockquote>

				<p>McTeague had grown up in a mining camp in the mountains.
				He remembered the years he had spent there trundling
				heavy cars of ore in and out of the tunnel under the direction
				of his father. For thirteen days out of each fortnight his father
				was a steady, hard-working shift-boss of the mine. Every
				other Sunday he became an irresponsible animal, a beast, a
				brute, crazed with alcohol. His mother cooked for the miners.
				Her one ambition was that her son should enter a profession.
				He was apprenticed to a traveling quack dentist and after a
				fashion, learned the business.</p>

				<blockquote>
					<p>&#8220;Then one day at San Francisco had come the news
					of his mother&#8217;s death; she had left him some money&#8212;not
					much, but enough to set him up in business; so he
					had cut loose from the charlatan and had opened his
					&#8216;Dental Parlors&#8217; on Polk street, an &#8216;accommodation
					street&#8217; of small shops in the residence quarter of the
					town. Here he had slowly collected a clientele of
					butcher boys, shop girls, drug clerks and car conductors.
					He made but few acquaintances. Polk street called him
					the &#8216;doctor&#8217; and spoke of his enormous strength. For
					McTeague was a young giant, carrying his huge shock of
					blonde hair six feet three inches from the ground; moving
					his immense limbs, heavy with ropes of muscle,
					slowly, ponderously. His hands were enormous, red,
					and covered with a fell of stiff yellow hair; they were as
					hard as wooden mallets, strong as vices, the hands of the
					old-time car boy. Often he dispensed with forceps and
					extracted a refractory tooth with his thumb and finger.
					His head was square-cut, angular; the jaw salient: like
					that of the carnivora.</p>

					<p>&#8220;But for one thing McTeague would have been perfectly
					<a class="pagenum" id="page240" title="240">&nbsp;</a>contented. Just outside his window was his signboard&#8212;a
					modest affair&#8212;that read: &#8216;Doctor McTeague.
					Dental Parlors. Gas Given;&#8217; but that was all. It was his
					ambition, his dream, to have projecting from that
					corner window a huge gilded tooth, a molar with enormous
					prongs, something gorgeous and attractive. He
					would have it some day, but as yet it was far beyond his
					means.&#8221;</p>
				</blockquote>

				<p>Then Mr. Norris launches into a description of the street
				in which &#8220;McTeague&#8221; lives. He presents that street as it
				is on Sunday, as it is on working days; as it is in the early
				dawn when the workmen are going out with pickaxes on
				their shoulders, as it is at ten o&#8217;clock when the women
				are out purchasing from the small shopkeepers, as it is at
				night when the shop girls are out with the soda-fountain
				tenders and the motor cars dash by full of theatre-goers, and
				the Salvationists sing before the saloon on the corner. In four
				pages he reproduces the life in a by-street of a great city, the
				little tragedy of the small shopkeeper. There are many ways of
				handling environment&#8212;most of them bad. When a young
				author has very little to say and no story worth telling, he
				resorts to environment. It is frequently used to disguise a
				weakness of structure, as ladies who paint landscapes put their
				cows knee-deep in water to conceal the defective drawing of
				the legs. But such description as one meets throughout
				Mr. Norris&#8217; book is in itself convincing proof of power, imagination
				and literary skill. It is a positive and active force,
				stimulating the reader&#8217;s imagination, giving him an actual
				command, a realizing sense of this world into which he is
				suddenly transplanted. It gives to the book perspective, atmosphere,
				effects of time and distance, creates the illusion of life.
				This power of mature, and accurate and comprehensive description
				is very unusual among the younger American writers.
				Most of them observe the world through a temperament,
				and are more occupied with their medium than the objects
				they see. And temperament is a glass which distorts most astonishingly.
				But this young man sees with a clear eye, and
				reproduces with a touch firm and decisive, strong almost to
				<a class="pagenum" id="page241" title="241">&nbsp;</a>brutalness. Yet this hand that can depict so powerfully the
				brute strength and brute passions of a &#8220;McTeague,&#8221; can deal
				very finely and adroitly with the feminine element of his story.
				This is his portrait of the little Swiss girl, &#8220;Trina,&#8221; whom the
				dentist marries:</p>

				<blockquote>
					<p>&#8220;Trina was very small and prettily made. Her face was
					round and rather pale; her eyes long and narrow and
					blue, like the half-opened eyes of a baby; her lips and
					the lobes of her tiny ears were pale, a little suggestive of
					anaemia. But it was to her hair that one&#8217;s attention was
					most attracted. Heaps and heaps of blue-black coils and
					braids, a royal crown of swarthy bands, a veritable sable
					tiara, heavy, abundant and odorous. All the vitality that
					should have given color to her face seemed to have been
					absorbed by that marvelous hair: It was the coiffure of a
					queen that shadowed the temples of this little bourgeoise.&#8221;</p>
				</blockquote>

				<p>The tragedy of the story dates from a chance, a seeming
				stroke of good fortune, one of those terrible gifts of the
				Danai. A few weeks before her marriage &#8220;Trina&#8221; drew $5&nbsp;000
				from a lottery ticket. From that moment her passion for
				hoarding money becomes the dominant theme of the story,
				takes command of the book and its characters. After their
				marriage the dentist is disbarred from practice. They move
				into a garret where she starves her husband and herself to
				save that precious hoard. She sells even his office furniture,
				everything but his concertina and his canary bird, with which
				he stubbornly refuses to part and which are destined to become
				very important accessories in the property room of
				the theatre where this drama is played. This removal from
				their first home is to this story what Gervaise&#8217;s removal from
				her shop is to L&#8217;Assommoir; it is the fatal episode of the third
				act, the sacrifice of self-respect, the beginning of the end.
				From that time the money stands between &#8220;Trina&#8221; and her
				husband. Outraged and humiliated, hating her for her meanness,
				demoralized by his idleness and despair, he begins to
				abuse her. The story becomes a careful and painful study of
				the disintegration of this union, a penetrating and searching
				<a class="pagenum" id="page242" title="242">&nbsp;</a>analysis of the degeneration of these two souls, the woman&#8217;s
				corroded by greed, the man&#8217;s poisoned by disappointment
				and hate.</p>

				<p>And all the while this same painful theme is placed in a
				lower key. Maria, the housemaid who took care of &#8220;McTeague&#8217;s&#8221;
				dental parlors in his better days, was a half-crazy
				girl from somewhere in Central America, she herself did not
				remember just where. But she had a wonderful story about
				her people owning a dinner service of pure gold with a punch
				bowl you could scarcely lift, which rang like a church bell
				when you struck it. On the strength of this story &#8220;Zercow,&#8221;
				the Jew junk man, marries her, and believing that she knows
				where this treasure is hidden, bullies and tortures her to force
				her to disclose her secret. At last &#8220;Maria&#8221; is found with her
				throat cut, and &#8220;Zercow&#8221; is picked up by the wharf with a
				sack full of rusty tin cans, which in his dementia he must have
				thought the fabled dinner service of gold.</p>

				<p>From this it is a short step to &#8220;McTeague&#8217;s&#8221; crime. He kills
				his wife to get possession of her money, and escapes to the
				mountains. While he is on his way south, pushing toward
				Mexico, he is overtaken by his murdered wife&#8217;s cousin and
				former suitor. Both men are half mad with thirst, and there in
				the desert wastes of Death&#8217;s Valley, they spring to their last
				conflict. The cousin falls, but before he dies he slips a handcuff
				over &#8220;McTeague&#8217;s&#8221; arm, and so the author leaves his hero
				in the wastes of Death&#8217;s Valley, a hundred miles from water,
				with a dead man chained to his arm. As he stands there the
				canary bird, the survivor of his happier days, to which he had
				clung with stubborn affection, begins &#8220;chittering feebly in its
				little gilt prison.&#8221; It reminds one a little of Stevenson&#8217;s use of
				poor &#8220;Goddedaal&#8217;s&#8221; canary in &#8220;The Wrecker.&#8221; It is just such
				sharp, sure strokes that bring out the high lights in a story
				and separate excellence from the commonplace. They are at
				once dramatic and revelatory. Lacking them, a novel which
				may otherwise be a good one, lacks its chief reason for being.
				The fault with many worthy attempts at fiction lies not in
				what they are, but in what they are not.</p>

				<p>Mr. Norris&#8217; model, if he will admit that he has followed
				one, is clearly no less a person than M. Zola himself. Yet there
				is no discoverable trace of imitation in his book. He has
				<a class="pagenum" id="page243" title="243">&nbsp;</a>simply taken a method which has been most successfully applied
				in the study of French life and applied it in studying
				American life, as one uses certain algebraic formulae to solve
				certain problems. It is perhaps the only truthful literary
				method of dealing with that part of society which environment
				and heredity hedge about like the walls of a prison. It is
				true that Mr. Norris now and then allows his &#8220;method&#8221; to
				become too prominent, that his restraint savors of constraint,
				yet he has written a true story of the people, courageous, dramatic,
				full of matter and warm with life. He has addressed
				himself seriously to art, and he seems to have no ambition to
				be clever. His horizon is wide, his invention vigorous and
				bold, his touch heavy and warm and human. This man is not
				limited by literary prejudices: he sees the people as they are,
				he is close to them and not afraid of their unloveliness. He
				has looked at truth in the depths, among men begrimed by
				toil and besotted by ignorance, and still found her fair. &#8220;McTeague&#8221;
				is an achievement for a young man. It may not win at
				once the success which it deserves, but Mr. Norris is one of
				those who can afford to wait.</p>

				<p>If you want to read a story that is all wheat and no chaff,
				read &#8220;Blix.&#8221; Last winter that brilliant young Californian, Mr.
				Norris, published a remarkable and gloomy novel, &#8220;McTeague,&#8221;
				a book deep in insight, rich in promise and splendid
				in execution, but entirely without charm and as disagreeable
				as only a great piece of work can be. And now this gentleman,
				who is not yet thirty, turns around and gives us an idyll that
				sings through one&#8217;s brain like a summer wind and makes one
				feel young enough to commit all manner of indiscretions. It
				may be that Mr. Norris is desirous of showing us his versatility
				and that he can follow any suit, or it may have been a
				process of reaction. I believe it was after M. Zola had completed
				one of his greatest and darkest novels of Parisian life
				that he went down to the seaside and wrote &#8220;La Reve,&#8221; a
				book that every girl should read when she is eighteen, and
				then again when she is eighty. Powerful and solidly built as
				<a class="pagenum" id="page244" title="244">&nbsp;</a>&#8220;McTeague&#8221; is, one felt that there method was carried almost
				too far, that Mr. Norris was too consciously influenced by his
				French masters. But &#8220;Blix&#8221; belongs to no school whatever,
				and there is not a shadow of pedantry or pride of craft in it
				from cover to cover. &#8220;Blix&#8221; herself is the method, the motives
				and the aim of the book. The story is an exhalation of youth
				and spring; it is the work of a man who breaks loose and
				forgets himself. Mr. Norris was married only last summer,
				and the march from &#8220;Lohengrin&#8221; is simply sticking out all
				over &#8220;Blix.&#8221; It is the story of a San Francisco newspaper man
				and a girl. The newspaper man &#8220;came out&#8221; in fiction, so to
				speak, in the drawing room of Mr. Richard Harding Davis,
				and has languished under that gentleman&#8217;s chaperonage until
				he has come to be regarded as a fellow careful of nothing but
				his toilet and his dinner. Mr. Davis&#8217; reporters all bathed regularly
				and all ate nice things, but beyond that their tastes were
				rather colorless. I am glad to see one red-blooded newspaper
				man, in the person of &#8220;Landy Rivers,&#8221; of San Francisco,
				break into fiction; a real live reporter with no sentimental loyalty
				for his &#8220;paper,&#8221; and no Byronic poses about his vices, and
				no astonishing taste about his clothes, and no money whatever,
				which is the natural and normal condition of all reporters.
				&#8220;Blix&#8221; herself was just a society girl, and &#8220;Landy&#8221; took
				her to theatres and parties and tried to make himself believe
				he was in love with her. But it wouldn&#8217;t work, for &#8220;Landy&#8221;
				couldn&#8217;t love a society girl, not though she were as beautiful
				as the morning and terrible as an army with banners, and had
				&#8220;round full arms,&#8221; and &#8220;the skin of her face was white and
				clean, except where it flushed into a most charming pink
				upon her smooth, cool cheeks.&#8221; For while &#8220;Landy Rivers&#8221;
				was at college he had been seized with the penchant for writing
				short stories, and had worshiped at the shrines of Maupassant
				and Kipling, and when a man is craft mad enough to
				worship Maupassant truly and know him well, when he has
				that tingling for technique in his fingers, not Aphrodite herself,
				new risen from the waves, could tempt him into any
				world where craft was not lord and king. So it happened that
				their real love affair never began until one morning when
				&#8220;Landy&#8221; had to go down to the wharf to write up a whaleback,
				and &#8220;Blix&#8221; went along, and an old sailor told them a
				<a class="pagenum" id="page245" title="245">&nbsp;</a>story and &#8220;Blix&#8221; recognized the literary possibilities of it, and
				they had lunch in a Chinese restaurant, and &#8220;Landy&#8221; because
				he was a newspaper man and it was the end of the week,
				didn&#8217;t have any change about his clothes, and &#8220;Blix&#8221; had to
				pay the bill. And it was in that green old tea house that
				&#8220;Landy&#8221; read &#8220;Blix&#8221; one of his favorite yarns by Kipling, and
				she in a calm, off-handed way, recognized one of the fine,
				technical points in it, and &#8220;Landy&#8221; almost went to pieces for
				joy of her doing it. That scene in the Chinese restaurant is
				one of the prettiest bits of color you&#8217;ll find to rest your eyes
				upon, and mighty good writing it is. I wonder, though if
				when Mr. Norris adroitly mentioned the &#8220;clack and snarl&#8221; of
				the banjo &#8220;Landy&#8221; played, he remembered the &#8220;silver snarling
				trumpets&#8221; of Keats? After that, things went on as such things
				will, and &#8220;Blix&#8221; quit the society racket and went to queer
				places with &#8220;Landy,&#8221; and got interested in his work, and she
				broke him of wearing red neckties and playing poker, and she
				made him work, she did, for she grew to realize how much
				that meant to him, and she jacked him up when he didn&#8217;t
				work, and she suggested an ending for one of his stories that
				was better than his own; just this big, splendid girl, who had
				never gone to college to learn how to write novels. And so
				how, in the name of goodness, could he help loving her? So
				one morning down by the Pacific, with &#8220;Blix&#8221; and &#8220;The
				Seven Seas,&#8221; it all came over &#8220;Landy,&#8221; that &#8220;living was better
				than reading and life was better than literature.&#8221; And so it is;
				once, and only once, for each of us; and that is the tune that
				sings and sings through one&#8217;s head when one puts the book
				away.</p>

			<div id="norris_3" class="review">
				<h4>An Heir Apparent.</h4>

				<p>Last winter a young Californian, Mr. Frank Norris, published
				a novel with the unpretentious title, &#8220;McTeague: a
				Story of San Francisco.&#8221; It was a book that could not be ignored
				nor dismissed with a word. There was something very
				unusual about it, about its solidity and mass, the thoroughness
				<a class="pagenum" id="page246" title="246">&nbsp;</a>and firmness of texture, and it came down like a blow
				from a sledge hammer among the slighter and more sprightly
				performances of the hour.</p>

				<p>The most remarkable thing about the book was its maturity
				and compactness. It has none of the ear-marks of those entertaining
				&#8220;young writers&#8221; whom every season produces as inevitably
				as its debutantes, young men who surprise for an hour
				and then settle down to producing industriously for the class
				with which their peculiar trick of phrase has found favor. It
				was a book addressed to the American people and to the critics
				of the world, the work of a young man who had set himself
				to the art of authorship with an almighty seriousness, and
				who had no ambition to be clever. &#8220;McTeague&#8221; was not an
				experiment in style nor a pretty piece of romantic folly, it was
				a true story of the people&#8212;having about it, as M. Zola
				would say, &#8220;the smell of the people&#8221;&#8212;courageous, dramatic,
				full of matter and warm with life. It was realism of the most
				uncompromising kind. The theme was such that the author
				could not have expected sudden popularity for his book, such
				as sometimes overtakes monstrosities of style in these discouraging
				days when Knighthood is in Flower to the extent of a
				quarter of a million copies, nor could he have hoped for
				pressing commissions from the fire-side periodicals. The life
				story of a quack dentist who sometimes extracted molars with
				his fingers, who mistreated and finally murdered his wife, is
				not, in itself, attractive. But, after all, the theme counts for
				very little. Every newspaper contains the essential subject matter
				for another <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Comedie Humaine</em>. The important point is that
				a man considerably under thirty could take up a subject so
				grim and unattractive, and that, for the mere love of doing
				things well, he was able to hold himself down to the task of
				developing it completely, that he was able to justify this
				quack&#8217;s existence in literature, to thrust this hairy, blonde
				dentist with the &#8220;salient jaw of the carnivora,&#8221; in amongst the
				immortals.</p>

				<p>It was after M. Zola had completed one of the greatest and
				gloomiest of his novels of Parisian life, that he went down by
				the sea and wrote &#8220;La Reve,&#8221; that tender, adolescent story of
				love and purity and youth. So, almost simultaneously with
				&#8220;McTeague,&#8221; Mr. Norris published &#8220;Blix,&#8221; another San Francisco
				<a class="pagenum" id="page247" title="247">&nbsp;</a>story, as short as &#8220;McTeague&#8221; was lengthy, as light as
				&#8220;McTeague&#8221; was heavy, as poetic and graceful as &#8220;McTeague&#8221;
				was somber and charmless. Here is a man worth waiting on; a
				man who is both realist and poet, a man who can teach</p>

				<blockquote class="poem">
					<p class="i2">&#8220;Not only by a comet&#8217;s rush,</p>
					<p>But by a rose&#8217;s birth.&#8221;</p>
				</blockquote>

				<p>Yet unlike as they are, in both books the source of power is
				the same, and, for that matter, it was even the same in his first
				book, &#8220;Moran of the Lady Letty.&#8221; Mr. Norris has dispensed
				with the conventional symbols that have crept into art, with
				the trite, half-truths and circumlocutions, and got back to the
				physical basis of things. He has abjured tea-table psychology,
				and the analysis of figures in the carpet and subtile dissections
				of intellectual impotencies, and the diverting game of words
				and the whole literature of the nerves. He is big and warm
				and sometimes brutal, and the strength of the soil comes up
				to him with very little loss in the transmission. His art strikes
				deep down into the roots of life and the foundation of Things
				as They Are&#8212;not as we tell each other they are at the tea-table.
				But he is realistic art, not artistic realism. He is courageous,
				but he is without bravado.</p>

				<p>He sees things freshly, as though they had not been seen
				before, and describes them with singular directness and vividness,
				not with morbid acuteness, with a large, wholesome joy
				of life. Nowhere is this more evident than in his insistent use
				of environment. I recall the passage in which he describes the
				street in which McTeague lives. He represents that street as it
				is on Sunday, as it is on working days, as it is in the early
				dawn when the workmen are going out with pickaxes on
				their shoulders, as it is at ten o&#8217;clock when the women are out
				marketing among the small shopkeepers, as it is at night when
				the shop girls are out with the soda fountain tenders and the
				motor cars dash by full of theater-goers, and the Salvationists
				sing before the saloon on the corner. In four pages he reproduces
				in detail the life in a by-street of a great city, the little
				tragedy of the small shopkeeper. There are many ways of
				handling environment&#8212;most of them bad. When a young
				author has very little to say and no story worth telling, he
				resorts to environment. It is frequently used to disguise a
				<a class="pagenum" id="page248" title="248">&nbsp;</a>weakness of structure, as ladies who paint landscapes put their
				cows knee-deep in water to conceal the defective drawing of
				the legs. But such description as one meets throughout
				Mr. Norris&#8217; book is in itself convincing proof of power, imagination
				and literary skill. It is a positive and active force,
				stimulating the reader&#8217;s imagination, giving him an actual
				command, a realizing sense of this world into which he is
				suddenly transported. It gives to the book perspective, atmosphere,
				effects of time and distance, creates the illusion of life.
				This power of mature and comprehensive description is very
				unusual among the younger American writers. Most of them
				observe the world through a temperament, and are more occupied
				with their medium than the objects they watch. And
				temperament is a glass which distorts most astonishingly. But
				this young man sees with a clear eye, and reproduces with a
				touch, firm and decisive, strong almost to brutalness.</p>

				<p>Mr. Norris approaches things on their physical side; his
				characters are personalities of flesh before they are anything
				else, types before they are individuals. Especially is this true of
				his women. His Trina is &#8220;very small and prettily made. Her
				face was round and rather pale; her eyes long and narrow and
				blue, like the half-opened eyes of a baby; her lips and the
				lobes of her tiny ears were pale, a little suggestive of anaemia.
				But it was to her hair that one&#8217;s attention was most attracted.
				Heaps and heaps of blue-black coils and braids, a royal crown
				of swarthy bands, a veritable sable tiara, heavy, abundant and
				odorous. All the vitality that should have given color to her
				face seems to have been absorbed by that marvelous hair. It
				was the coiffure of a queen that shadowed the temples of this
				little bourgeoise.&#8221; Blix had &#8220;round, full arms,&#8221; and &#8220;the skin
				of her face was white and clean, except where it flushed into a
				most charming pink upon her smooth, cool cheeks.&#8221; In this
				grasp of the element of things, this keen, clean, frank pleasure
				at color and odor and warmth, this candid admission of the
				negative of beauty, which is co-existent with and inseparable
				from it, lie much of his power and promise. Here is a man
				catholic enough to include the extremes of physical and moral
				life, strong enough to handle the crudest colors and darkest
				shadows. Here is a man who has an appetite for the physical
				universe, who loves the rank smells of crowded alley-ways, or
				<a class="pagenum" id="page249" title="249">&nbsp;</a>the odors of boudoirs, or the delicate perfume exhaled from a
				woman&#8217;s skin; who is not afraid of Pan, be he ever so shaggy,
				and redolent of the herd.</p>

				<p>Structurally, where most young novelists are weak, Mr.
				Norris is very strong. He has studied the best French masters,
				and he has adopted their methods quite simply, as one selects
				an algebraic formula to solve his particular problem. As to his
				style, that is, as expression always is, just as vigorous as his
				thought compels it to be, just as vivid as his conception warrants.
				If God Almighty has given a man ideas, he will get
				himself a style from one source or another. Mr. Norris, fortunately,
				is not a conscious stylist. He has too much to say to be
				exquisitely vain about his medium. He has the kind of brain
				stuff that would vanquish difficulties in any profession, that
				might be put to building battleships, or solving problems of
				finance, or to devising colonial policies. Let us be thankful
				that he has put it to literature. Let us be thankful, moreover,
				that he is not introspective and that his intellect does not devour
				itself, but feeds upon the great race of man, and, above
				all, let us rejoice that he is not a &#8220;temperamental&#8221; artist, but
				something larger, for a great brain and an assertive temperament
				seldom dwell together.</p>

				<p>There are clever men enough in the field of American
				letters, and the fault of most of them is merely one of magnitude;
				they are not large enough; they travel in small orbits,
				they play on muted strings. They sing neither of the combats
				of Atriedes nor the labors of Cadmus, but of the tea-table and
				the Odyssey of the Rialto. Flaubert said that a drop of water
				contained all the elements of the sea, save one&#8212;immensity.
				Mr. Norris is concerned only with serious things, he has only
				large ambitions. His brush is bold, his color is taken fresh
				from the kindly earth, his canvas is large enough to hold
				American life, the real life of the people. He has come into
				the court of the troubadours singing the song of Elys, the
				song of warm, full nature. He has struck the true note of the
				common life. He is what Mr. Norman Hapgood said the
				great American dramatist must be: &#8220;A large human being,
				with a firm stomach, who knows and loves the people.&#8221;</p>

			<h3 class="essay_title">When I Knew Stephen Crane <a class="return_toc" href="#contents" title="Return to Contents">ToC</a></h3>
			<p class="first_paragraph">It was, I think, in the spring of &#8217;94 that a slender, narrow-chested
			fellow in a shabby grey suit, with a soft felt hat
			pulled low over his eyes, sauntered into the office of the managing
			editor of the Nebraska State Journal and introduced
			himself as Stephen Crane. He stated that he was going to
			Mexico to do some work for the Bacheller Syndicate and get
			rid of his cough, and that he would be stopping in Lincoln
			for a few days. Later he explained that he was out of money
			and would be compelled to wait until he got a check from the
			East before he went further. I was a Junior at the Nebraska
			State University at the time, and was doing some work for the
			State Journal in my leisure time, and I happened to be in the
			managing editor&#8217;s room when Mr. Crane introduced himself.
			I was just off the range; I knew a little Greek and something
			about cattle and a good horse when I saw one, and beyond
			horses and cattle I considered nothing of vital importance except
			good stories and the people who wrote them. This was
			the first man of letters I had ever met in the flesh, and when
			the young man announced who he was, I dropped into a
			chair behind the editor&#8217;s desk where I could stare at him
			without being too much in evidence.</p>

			<p>Only a very youthful enthusiasm and a large propensity for
			hero worship could have found anything impressive in the
			young man who stood before the managing editor&#8217;s desk. He
			was thin to emaciation, his face was gaunt and unshaven, a
			thin dark moustache straggled on his upper lip, his black hair
			grew low on his forehead and was shaggy and unkempt. His
			grey clothes were much the worse for wear and fitted him so
			badly it seemed unlikely he had ever been measured for them.
			He wore a flannel shirt and a slovenly apology for a necktie,
			and his shoes were dusty and worn gray about the toes and
			were badly run over at the heel. I had seen many a tramp
			printer come up the Journal stairs to hunt a job, but never one
			who presented such a disreputable appearance as this story-maker
			man. He wore gloves, which seemed rather a contradiction
			to the general slovenliness of his attire, but when he
			<a class="pagenum" id="page251" title="251">&nbsp;</a>took them off to search his pockets for his credentials, I noticed
			that his hands were singularly fine; long, white, and delicately
			shaped, with thin, nervous fingers. I have seen pictures
			of Aubrey Beardsley&#8217;s hands that recalled Crane&#8217;s very vividly.</p>

			<p>At that time Crane was but twenty-four, and almost an unknown
			man. Hamlin Garland had seen some of his work and
			believed in him, and had introduced him to Mr. Howells,
			who recommended him to the Bacheller Syndicate. &#8220;The Red
			Badge of Courage&#8221; had been published in the State Journal
			that winter along with a lot of other syndicate matter, and
			the grammatical construction of the story was so faulty that
			the managing editor had several times called on me to edit the
			copy. In this way I had read it very carefully, and through
			the careless sentence-structure I saw the wonder of that remarkable
			performance. But the grammar certainly was bad. I
			remember one of the reporters who had corrected the phrase
			&#8220;it don&#8217;t&#8221; for the tenth time remarked savagely, &#8220;If I couldn&#8217;t
			write better English than this, I&#8217;d quit.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Crane spent several days in the town, living from hand to
			mouth and waiting for his money. I think he borrowed a
			small amount from the managing editor. He lounged about
			the office most of the time, and I frequently encountered him
			going in and out of the cheap restaurants on Tenth Street.
			When he was at the office he talked a good deal in a wandering,
			absent-minded fashion, and his conversation was uniformly
			frivolous. If he could not evade a serious question by a
			joke, he bolted. I cut my classes to lie in wait for him, confident
			that in some unwary moment I could trap him into serious
			conversation, that if one burned incense long enough and
			ardently enough, the oracle would not be dumb. I was Maupassant
			mad at the time, a malady particularly unattractive in
			a Junior, and I made a frantic effort to get an expression of
			opinion from him on &#8220;Le Bonheur.&#8221; &#8220;Oh, you&#8217;re Moping, are
			you?&#8221; he remarked with a sarcastic grin, and went on reading
			a little volume of Poe that he carried in his pocket. At another
			time I cornered him in the Funny Man&#8217;s room and succeeded
			in getting a little out of him. We were taught literature by an
			exceedingly analytical method at the University, and we probably
			distorted the method, and I was busy trying to find the
			least common multiple of <cite>Hamlet</cite> and the greatest common
			<a class="pagenum" id="page252" title="252">&nbsp;</a>divisor of <cite>Macbeth</cite>, and I began asking him whether stories
			were constructed by cabalistic formulae. At length he sighed
			wearily and shook his drooping shoulders, remarking:</p>

			<p>&#8220;Where did you get all that rot? Yarns aren&#8217;t done by mathematics.
			You can&#8217;t do it by rule any more than you can dance
			by rule. You have to have the itch of the thing in your fingers,
			and if you haven&#8217;t,&#8212;well, you&#8217;re damned lucky, and you&#8217;ll
			live long and prosper, that&#8217;s all.&#8221;&#8212;And with that he yawned
			and went down the hall.</p>

			<p>Crane was moody most of the time, his health was bad and
			he seemed profoundly discouraged. Even his jokes were exceedingly
			drastic. He went about with the tense, preoccupied,
			self-centered air of a man who is brooding over some impending
			disaster, and I conjectured vainly as to what it might be.
			Though he was seemingly entirely idle during the few days I
			knew him, his manner indicated that he was in the throes of
			work that told terribly on his nerves. His eyes I remember as
			the finest I have ever seen, large and dark and full of lustre
			and changing lights, but with a profound melancholy always
			lurking deep in them. They were eyes that seemed to be burning
			themselves out.</p>

			<p>As he sat at the desk with his shoulders drooping forward,
			his head low, and his long, white fingers drumming on the
			sheets of copy paper, he was as nervous as a race horse fretting
			to be on the track. Always, as he came and went about
			the halls, he seemed like a man preparing for a sudden departure.
			Now that he is dead it occurs to me that all his life was a
			preparation for sudden departure. I remember once when he
			was writing a letter he stopped and asked me about the spelling
			of a word, saying carelessly, &#8220;I haven&#8217;t time to learn to
			spell.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Then, glancing down at his attire, he added with an absent-minded
			smile, &#8220;I haven&#8217;t time to dress either; it takes an awful
			slice out of a fellow&#8217;s life.&#8221;</p>

			<p>He said he was poor, and he certainly looked it, but four
			years later when he was in Cuba, drawing the largest salary
			ever paid a newspaper correspondent, he clung to this same
			untidy manner of dress, and his ragged overalls and buttonless
			shirt were eyesores to the immaculate Mr. Davis, in his
			spotless linen and neat khaki uniform, with his Gibson chin
			<a class="pagenum" id="page253" title="253">&nbsp;</a>always freshly shaven. When I first heard of his serious illness,
			his old throat trouble aggravated into consumption by his
			reckless exposure in Cuba, I recalled a passage from Maeterlinck&#8217;s
			essay, &#8220;The Pre-Destined,&#8221; on those doomed to early
			death: &#8220;As children, life seems nearer to them than to other
			children. They appear to know nothing, and yet there is in
			their eyes so profound a certainty that we feel they must
			know all.&#8212;In all haste, but wisely and with minute care do
			they prepare themselves to live, and this very haste is a sign
			upon which mothers can scarce bring themselves to look.&#8221; I
			remembered, too, the young man&#8217;s melancholy and his tenseness,
			his burning eyes, and his way of slurring over the less
			important things, as one whose time is short.</p>

			<p>I have heard other people say how difficult it was to induce
			Crane to talk seriously about his work, and I suspect that he
			was particularly averse to discussions with literary men of
			wider education and better equipment than himself, yet he
			seemed to feel that this fuller culture was not for him. Perhaps
			the unreasoning instinct which lies deep in the roots of our
			lives, and which guides us all, told him that he had not time
			enough to acquire it.</p>

			<p>Men will sometimes reveal themselves to children, or to
			people whom they think never to see again, more completely
			than they ever do to their confreres. From the wise we hold
			back alike our folly and our wisdom, and for the recipients of
			our deeper confidences we seldom select our equals. The soul
			has no message for the friends with whom we dine every
			week. It is silenced by custom and convention, and we play
			only in the shallows. It selects its listeners willfully, and seemingly
			delights to waste its best upon the chance wayfarer who
			meets us in the highway at a fated hour. There are moments
			too, when the tides run high or very low, when self-revelation
			is necessary to every man, if it be only to his valet or his
			gardener. At such a moment, I was with Mr. Crane.</p>

			<p>The hoped for revelation came unexpectedly enough. It was
			on the last night he spent in Lincoln. I had come back from
			the theatre and was in the Journal office writing a notice of
			the play. It was eleven o&#8217;clock when Crane came in. He had
			expected his money to arrive on the night mail and it had not
			done so, and he was out of sorts and deeply despondent. He
			<a class="pagenum" id="page254" title="254">&nbsp;</a>sat down on the ledge of the open window that faced on the
			street, and when I had finished my notice I went over and
			took a chair beside him. Quite without invitation on my part,
			Crane began to talk, began to curse his trade from the first
			throb of creative desire in a boy to the finished work of the
			master. The night was oppressively warm; one of those dry
			winds that are the curse of that country was blowing up from
			Kansas. The white, western moonlight threw sharp, blue
			shadows below us. The streets were silent at that hour, and
			we could hear the gurgle of the fountain in the Post Office
			square across the street, and the twang of banjos from the
			lower verandah of the Hotel Lincoln, where the colored waiters
			were serenading the guests. The drop lights in the office
			were dull under their green shades, and the telegraph sounder
			clicked faintly in the next room. In all his long tirade, Crane
			never raised his voice; he spoke slowly and monotonously and
			even calmly, but I have never known so bitter a heart in any
			man as he revealed to me that night. It was an arraignment of
			the wages of life, an invocation to the ministers of hate.</p>

			<p>Incidentally he told me the sum he had received for &#8220;The
			Red Badge of Courage,&#8221; which I think was something like
			ninety dollars, and he repeated some lines from &#8220;The Black
			Riders,&#8221; which was then in preparation. He gave me to understand
			that he led a double literary life; writing in the first
			place the matter that pleased himself, and doing it very
			slowly; in the second place, any sort of stuff that would sell.
			And he remarked that his poor was just as bad as it could
			possibly be. He realized, he said, that his limitations were absolutely
			impassable. &#8220;What I can&#8217;t do, I can&#8217;t do at all, and I
			can&#8217;t acquire it. I only hold one trump.&#8221;</p>

			<p>He had no settled plans at all. He was going to Mexico
			wholly uncertain of being able to do any successful work
			there, and he seemed to feel very insecure about the financial
			end of his venture. The thing that most interested me was
			what he said about his slow method of composition. He declared
			that there was little money in story-writing at best, and
			practically none in it for him, because of the time it took him
			to work up his detail. Other men, he said, could sit down and
			write up an experience while the physical effect of it, so to
			speak, was still upon them, and yesterday&#8217;s impressions made
			<a class="pagenum" id="page255" title="255">&nbsp;</a>to-day&#8217;s &#8220;copy.&#8221; But when he came in from the streets to
			write up what he had seen there, his faculties were benumbed,
			and he sat twirling his pencil and hunting for words like a
			schoolboy.</p>

			<p>I mentioned &#8220;The Red Badge of Courage,&#8221; which was
			written in nine days, and he replied that, though the writing
			took very little time, he had been unconsciously working the
			detail of the story out through most of his boyhood. His
			ancestors had been soldiers, and he had been imagining war
			stories ever since he was out of knickerbockers, and in writing
			his first war story he had simply gone over his imaginary campaigns
			and selected his favorite imaginary experiences. He declared
			that his imagination was hide bound; it was there, but
			it pulled hard. After he got a notion for a story, months
			passed before he could get any sort of personal contract with
			it, or feel any potency to handle it. &#8220;The detail of a thing has
			to filter through my blood, and then it comes out like a native
			product, but it takes forever,&#8221; he remarked. I distinctly remember
			the illustration, for it rather took hold of me.</p>

			<p>I have often been astonished since to hear Crane spoken of
			as &#8220;the reporter in fiction,&#8221; for the reportorial faculty of
			superficial reception and quick transference was what he
			conspicuously lacked. His first newspaper account of his shipwreck
			on the filibuster &#8220;Commodore&#8221; off the Florida coast
			was as lifeless as the &#8220;copy&#8221; of a police court reporter. It was
			many months afterwards that the literary product of his terrible
			experience appeared in that marvellous sea story &#8220;The
			Open Boat,&#8221; unsurpassed in its vividness and constructive
			perfection.</p>

			<p>At the close of our long conversation that night, when the
			copy boy came in to take me home, I suggested to Crane that
			in ten years he would probably laugh at all his temporary
			discomfort. Again his body took on that strenuous tension
			and he clenched his hands, saying, &#8220;I can&#8217;t wait ten years, I
			haven&#8217;t time.&#8221;</p>

			<p>The ten years are not up yet, and he has done his work and
			gathered his reward and gone. Was ever so much experience
			and achievement crowded into so short a space of time? A
			great man dead at twenty-nine! That would have puzzled the
			ancients. Edward Garnett wrote of him in The Academy of
			<a class="pagenum" id="page256" title="256">&nbsp;</a>December 17, 1899: &#8220;I cannot remember a parallel in the literary
			history of fiction. Maupassant, Meredith, Henry James,
			Mr. Howells and Tolstoy, were all learning their expression at
			an age where Crane had achieved his and achieved it triumphantly.&#8221;
			He had the precocity of those doomed to die in
			youth. I am convinced that when I met him he had a vague
			premonition of the shortness of his working day, and in the
			heart of the man there was that which said, &#8220;That thou doest,
			do quickly.&#8221;</p>

			<p>At twenty-one this son of an obscure New Jersey rector,
			with but a scant reading knowledge of French and no training,
			had rivaled in technique the foremost craftsmen of the
			Latin races. In the six years since I met him, a stranded reporter,
			he stood in the firing line during two wars, knew hairbreadth
			&#8217;scapes on land and sea, and established himself as the
			first writer of his time in the picturing of episodic, fragmentary
			life. His friends have charged him with fickleness, but he
			was a man who was in the preoccupation of haste. He went
			from country to country, from man to man, absorbing all that
			was in them for him. He had no time to look backward. He
			had no leisure for <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">camaraderie</em>. He drank life to the lees, but
			at the banquet table where other men took their ease and
			jested over their wine, he stood a dark and silent figure, sombre
			as Poe himself, not wishing to be understood; and he
			took his portion in haste, with his loins girded, and his shoes
			on his feet, and his staff in his hand, like one who must depart
			quickly.</p>

			<h3 class="essay_title">On the Art of Fiction <a class="return_toc" href="#contents" title="Return to Contents">ToC</a></h3>
			<p class="first_paragraph">One is sometimes asked about the &#8220;obstacles&#8221; that confront
			young writers who are trying to do good work. I
			should say the greatest obstacles that writers today have to get
			over, are the dazzling journalistic successes of twenty years
			ago, stories that surprised and delighted by their sharp photographic
			detail and that were really nothing more than lively
			pieces of reporting. The whole aim of that school of writing
			was novelty&#8212;never a very important thing in art. They gave
			us, altogether, poor standards&#8212;taught us to multiply our
			ideas instead of to condense them. They tried to make a story
			out of every theme that occurred to them and to get returns
			on every situation that suggested itself. They got returns, of a
			kind. But their work, when one looks back on it, now that the
			novelty upon which they counted so much is gone, is journalistic
			and thin. The especial merit of a good reportorial story is
			that it shall be intensely interesting and pertinent today and
			shall have lost its point by tomorrow.</p>

			<p>Art, it seems to me, should simplify. That, indeed, is very
			nearly the whole of the higher artistic process; finding what
			conventions of form and what detail one can do without and
			yet preserve the spirit of the whole&#8212;so that all that one has
			suppressed and cut away is there to the reader&#8217;s consciousness
			as much as if it were in type on the page. Millet had done
			hundreds of sketches of peasants sowing grain, some of them
			very complicated and interesting, but when he came to paint
			the spirit of them all into one picture, &#8220;The Sower,&#8221; the composition
			is so simple that it seems inevitable. All the discarded
			sketches that went before made the picture what it finally became,
			and the process was all the time one of simplifying, of
			sacrificing many conceptions good in themselves for one that
			was better and more universal.</p>

			<p>Any first rate novel or story must have in it the strength of
			a dozen fairly good stories that have been sacrificed to it. A
			good workman can&#8217;t be a cheap workman; he can&#8217;t be stingy
			about wasting material, and he cannot compromise. Writing
			ought either to be the manufacture of stories for which there
			<a class="pagenum" id="page258" title="258">&nbsp;</a>is a market demand&#8212;a business as safe and commendable as
			making soap or breakfast foods&#8212;or it should be an art,
			which is always a search for something for which there is no
			market demand, something new and untried, where the
			values are intrinsic and have nothing to do with standardized
			values. The courage to go on without compromise does not
			come to a writer all at once&#8212;nor, for that matter, does the
			ability. Both are phases of natural development. In the beginning
			the artist, like his public, is wedded to old forms, old
			ideals, and his vision is blurred by the memory of old delights
			he would like to recapture.</p>
